Two months prior to our involvement,

the Lutz family had fled their home
in the middle of the night,

01:17.720 --> 01:20.393
claiming that the house was haunted.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.153
The Church had reached out to us for help.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.677

motivated purely by anger

to the Church for help?

Yes.

But truthfully, we've been
reluctant to get involved.

PEGGY: Janet.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.315
ED: It's okay. It's okay.
Come on. Come on.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.639
Come on, now.

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.797
It's okay. Watch out. Look out.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.672
- Slowly!
- Okay.

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:38.416
- Darling, it's all right.

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:41.477
It's all right, Mum's here.
Mum's here, darling.

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.512
How did she get in there?

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.197
It's all right, darling. What's that?

PEGGY: It's fine.

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:08.908
Can I, uh...

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.389
What is it?

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:16.878
She's faking it.

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.839
What?

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.872
I have proof.

So much for your leap of faith.

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:12.355
PEGGY: What?

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.753
My girl didn't make this up.
I've seen things.

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:17.792
She was caught red-handed faking an event.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.554
No, it's not possible.
Have you seen it in there?

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.354
How could a 12-year-old girl
throw a table across the room?

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.352
It's over. Do you understand?

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.997
For the sake of your daughter,
don't make this harder than it already is.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.428
(SOBBING)

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:32.596
She couldn't have pulled this off alone.

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:34.959
Oh, how dare you.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.953
What, you think I put her up to this?

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.396
What about the police?
Are they in on this, too?

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:40.755
No, it's all right.

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:42.393
What about you two?

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.438
You believe us, don't you?

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.833
We wanna help.

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:55.200
But the Church will take one look at
that video and that'll be the end of it.

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.990
They'll wanna distance themselves from
anything that remotely resembles a hoax.

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.516
(SOBBING)

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.676
I'd like you to leave, please.

01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:09.872
Now, go on, get out.

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:12.312
Get out, the lot of you!

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:14.429
Get out!

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:29.832
Perhaps, you could somehow
reach out to the spirit.

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.270
You know, make contact with it yourself.

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.516
I can't. Believe me, I've tried.

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:37.196
I'm sorry, I'm just not
sensing anything here.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.635
So, that's it, then?

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.400
You hold out a lifeline to them
and then you just throw it away?

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:43.471
We don't like this any more than you do.

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.751
We'll tell the Church
about everything we've seen.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.355
But, the only piece
of concrete evidence we've got,

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.200
is a video of Janet faking an incident.

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.035
Yeah, but there have been literally
dozens of genuine incidents.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.400
You might want this.

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:58.717
And, just because she faked it this once,
doesn't change the fact that...

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.080
No, it changes everything.

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.759
We're agents of the Church here.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.675
They'd be calling us home
even if Peggy hadn't asked us to leave.

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.915
You've done really
good work here, Maurice.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.191
You were here for them
when no one else was.

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.517
Uh, thank you.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.872
But, sometimes you need to
make a leap of faith.

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:29.240
Believe when nobody else will.

This doesn't feel right.

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:10.800
I know.

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.600

Wreck the kitchen and all that?

BILLY: But, why?

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.628
It said it would kill you,

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.433
if I didn't make them leave.

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.376
LORRAINE: Don't you think
it's a little convenient

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.080
that she just happened to fake an incident

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:18.238
in the one room of the house
that had a video camera pointing at it?

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:19.480
Yeah.

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.549
(GROANS) No.

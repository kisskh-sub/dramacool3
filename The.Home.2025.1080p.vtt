00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.023
...live on the ground
in Kingston.

00:00:57.065 --> 00:00:59.150
And while not officially
a hurricane,

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.527
these conditions
are quickly worsening.

00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:04.530
There's flooding in front of me
from heavy rain, Ben.

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:06.282
And looking out
on the coast,

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.368
you can see the conditions
are far, far worse.

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:11.788
High tide is at a season
record high,

00:01:11.913 --> 00:01:14.165
making its way to the streets.

00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:17.085
We have volunteers here
piling up sandbags

00:01:17.168 --> 00:01:19.629
and taking
other precautions we can.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:22.548
But we know this storm
will be devastating.

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:24.342
Back to you in the studio.

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:26.552
Thank you, Judy.
Stay safe out there.

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:27.929
We're watching this storm...

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.694
...we're expecting
storm surges,

00:01:43.778 --> 00:01:45.238
high winds, and heavy...

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:46.697
Raise a glass.

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:49.992
They call us a foster family.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.869
We don't call it that.

00:01:51.953 --> 00:01:53.913
We call it what it is...

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:56.874
A family.

00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.709
- To Luke!
- Yay, Luke!

00:01:58.793 --> 00:02:00.753
My boy is going to college.

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:03.840
Yes!

00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:05.258
- Thicker than blood?
- Always.

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:10.638
...it's likely the storm
will make its way north

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:12.974
and in the tri-state area
by the end of the week.

00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:36.164
Goddamn, little bro.

00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:38.791
Hey, this is some
of your best work.

00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:46.090
I can't believe
you're leaving me here.

00:02:46.174 --> 00:02:49.093
Hey, I'm not leaving you
anywhere.

00:02:49.177 --> 00:02:51.137
All right? I'm gonna write
all the time.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.931
I'll be an hour away.
I'll be home holidays
and summers.

00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:55.808
And in four years, I'm back.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.936
And it's me and you again,
charting our course.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.856
Like Dad said,
they call us foster brothers.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.443
But, Max, our bond
is thicker than blood.

00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:06.944
Always.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:51.614
Come on, baby. It's okay.
It'll be okay. It's...

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:53.574
Max.

00:03:53.658 --> 00:03:54.700
Come here, son.

00:03:57.078 --> 00:03:58.704
I don't know
how to say this, Max.

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:03.709
Luke...

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:06.420
i-is...

00:04:06.504 --> 00:04:08.005
- ...gone.
- Huh?

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:09.382
Your brother is gone.

00:04:10.258 --> 00:04:12.260
He left a note, Max.

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:16.055
He was having problems
at college.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.809
I don't understand...
I don't understand
why he wouldn't come to us.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:22.186
It's okay. It's okay.

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:32.280
Number 0426. Let's go.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.289
So how many times, Max?

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:44.583
Breaking into buildings,
destroying property.

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:47.420
You need to be held
accountable.

00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:51.590
- Ever since Luke died--
- I know. I know. I...

00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:55.720
I know. I'm familiar
with the speech.
You don't have to...

00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:58.055
tell me again
how disappointed
you are in me.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:04.353
- I made some calls...
- I didn't ask.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.605
I spoke to Judge Beric.
I begged him to help.

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:07.773
He did.

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:10.192
No jail time.

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.237
Community service.

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:16.532
Fuck. Okay.

00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:18.326
Thanks.

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:21.329
I thought I was going away.

00:05:23.164 --> 00:05:24.332
What do I have to do?

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:27.293
Judge asked me
if you were handy.

00:05:27.376 --> 00:05:28.711
I lied and said you were.

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:32.673
He said, "Well,
then he can spend
the next four months

00:05:32.757 --> 00:05:36.010
at Green Meadows Retirement Home
as the new onsite super."

00:05:37.553 --> 00:05:38.346
What?

00:05:39.388 --> 00:05:40.348
You're joking.

00:05:42.516 --> 00:05:44.643
An old folks home,
like with-with old people?

00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:47.396
What? I don't wanna--
I don't wanna do that shit.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.357
This is your last chance, son.

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:52.234
Play by the rules.

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:54.362
Otherwise you're gonna
end up in jail.

00:05:59.784 --> 00:06:00.743
When do I start?

00:07:45.473 --> 00:07:47.850
Cute. Who's that?
Your boyfriend?

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:53.647
The trash receptacles
have to be emptied twice a day.

00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:55.566
Carpets vacuumed daily.

00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:57.193
You saw how clean
this place was coming in?

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:58.235
Yes, sir.

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.154
Your job is to keep it that way.

00:08:00.237 --> 00:08:02.865
Mm-hmm. And this key,

00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:04.992
it'll open every room
in the home,

00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:07.870
with the exception
of a few hallways
and the basement.

00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:11.081
And don't enter
residential apartments
unless there's an emergency.

00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:12.833
- Right.
- "I've fallen and I can't get up"

00:08:12.917 --> 00:08:13.959
type of shit, you know?

00:08:14.043 --> 00:08:15.669
Just knock first.

00:08:17.171 --> 00:08:20.216
Oh, yeah.
And no fourth floor, darling.

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.968
Those patients
need special care.

00:08:23.052 --> 00:08:24.428
Off limits to you.

00:08:25.179 --> 00:08:27.056
- Simple, right?
- Mm-hmm.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:28.641
Just follow the rules

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:31.060
and we won't be obliged
to report you.

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:32.311
That's right.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.540
Come on!

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:19.400
Fuck!

00:09:31.495 --> 00:09:32.830
Hello. How are you?

00:09:41.005 --> 00:09:42.214
Here to get your garbage.

00:09:46.844 --> 00:09:47.845
All right, I'm coming in.

00:10:34.892 --> 00:10:37.102
Up and now strong.

00:10:37.186 --> 00:10:38.395
And to the right.

00:10:38.479 --> 00:10:39.938
Breathe.

00:10:40.022 --> 00:10:42.983
And up. And the left.

00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:44.401
And up.

00:10:44.485 --> 00:10:46.945
And, oh, to the right.

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:49.740
To the right.
Strong. Strong and now...

00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:51.325
Excuse me, son.
Could you get me a towel?

00:10:51.408 --> 00:10:54.203
- Yeah, sure.
- And back we go.

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:56.580
And spin your arms back.

00:10:56.664 --> 00:10:57.956
You're new.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.208
- Mm-hmm.
- Warming up. That's right.

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:01.669
I-I'm Norma.
I'm sorry. You-you...

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.214
You just look like someone
I once knew.

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:07.383
Well, I'm, uh,
I'm Max. I am new.

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:09.927
And, uh, it's really nice
to meet you, Norma.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.845
And forward and up.

00:11:11.929 --> 00:11:14.139
We are sky warriors.

00:11:14.223 --> 00:11:16.558
So how's your first day
going, Max?

00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:18.686
- We are youthful.
We are strong.
- Uh, it's...

00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:22.690
We are growing.
And, yes, and out and up.

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:27.027
And... Good God, Mrs. Fisher!

00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:29.863
She got in the pool
after her skin procedure.

00:11:29.947 --> 00:11:31.407
Come on, everybody. Hurry.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.574
- Blood. Blood.
- Oh, my God.

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:34.201
- What?
- Go help her.

00:11:34.284 --> 00:11:35.577
- Go, go.
- Up!
Out, out, out!

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:37.413
Everybody, come on.
There you are.

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:38.539
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:11:38.622 --> 00:11:40.040
Mrs. Fisher.

00:11:40.124 --> 00:11:42.334
- What do we do?
- Come on. Here you go.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.253
- Right here.
- Come on.

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:46.130
Everybody, out. Oh, oh!

00:11:46.213 --> 00:11:47.214
Come on.

00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:54.096
Best generation,
my fucking dick.

00:12:03.439 --> 00:12:05.691
These fucking boomers.

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:12.740
I just wanna go home.

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:35.262
Max!

00:13:22.017 --> 00:13:23.977
The storm
has now been upgraded

00:13:24.061 --> 00:13:26.188
to a hurricane.
They're calling it Greta.

00:13:26.271 --> 00:13:28.941
And it is moving up the coast
very, very quickly.

00:13:29.024 --> 00:13:31.860
I have to tell you,
it is extremely rare

00:13:31.944 --> 00:13:33.695
to have a storm
of this magnitude

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:35.906
hitting the East Coast
this time of year.

00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:38.784
One expert is saying
this is global warming.

00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:41.328
Hey, kid, get up!
Get up! Wake up!

00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:45.499
For fuck's sake.

00:13:45.582 --> 00:13:46.750
Jesus!

00:13:46.834 --> 00:13:48.168
- Yeah.
- Come on!

00:13:48.252 --> 00:13:49.878
Yeah. Okay.

00:13:50.754 --> 00:13:52.381
Please, kid, get up!

00:13:53.757 --> 00:13:55.342
Why do you take so long?

00:13:55.425 --> 00:13:57.010
- What's up?
- Come on, kid.

00:13:57.094 --> 00:14:00.097
We need you.
Ethan had a terrible accident.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.349
- The place is a mess.
- What do you mean "accident"?

00:14:02.432 --> 00:14:04.142
Shit his drawers
something wicked,

00:14:04.226 --> 00:14:06.019
seeped through his diaper.

00:14:06.103 --> 00:14:08.105
- Did you say "shit"?
- Excrement, fecal matter.

00:14:08.188 --> 00:14:10.774
- Yes, shit.
- He's painting
the walls with it.

00:14:10.858 --> 00:14:12.609
Oh, what do you want me
to do about it?

00:14:12.693 --> 00:14:14.570
We want you
to clean it up, kid.

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:16.238
- Yeah.
- You're the new super.

00:14:16.321 --> 00:14:17.948
- Oh, my God.
- - Right behind that door.

00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:19.783
I'd stop breathing
right about now.

00:14:19.867 --> 00:14:22.119
- Oh!
- Surprise!

00:14:32.296 --> 00:14:33.422
Yeah!

00:14:34.214 --> 00:14:36.174
So, no poopy diaper?

00:14:36.258 --> 00:14:38.427
No. No poo, kid.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.554
You know, I can't keep
calling you "kid," kid.

00:14:40.637 --> 00:14:42.639
- I'm Lou. What's your name?
- Uh, Max.

00:14:42.723 --> 00:14:44.641
- Max! Okay, Max.
- Max...

00:14:44.725 --> 00:14:48.604
Well, we heard that you had
a really rough day yesterday,

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:52.274
so we decided
that we would give you
a not-so-proper,

00:14:52.357 --> 00:14:54.776
but very warm welcome.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.613
So, welcome
to Green Meadows. Yay!

00:14:57.696 --> 00:14:58.864
- Whoo!
- Max!

00:15:06.663 --> 00:15:08.790
Ellie. She doesn't speak
English, Max.

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:11.460
She says welcome, as do I.

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:12.878
Thanks.

00:15:12.961 --> 00:15:15.088
- Good to see you again, Max.
- Hey.

00:15:15.172 --> 00:15:17.674
And, uh, if they keep
busting on you,
just let me know.

00:15:17.758 --> 00:15:19.051
I'll take care of them.

00:15:19.134 --> 00:15:22.012
And she means it too. Yeah.

00:15:22.095 --> 00:15:24.264
Nice to meet you,
and I'm so glad you're here.

00:15:24.348 --> 00:15:25.766
You got a great sense of humor.

00:15:25.849 --> 00:15:26.934
- Thanks.
- Okay.

00:15:58.423 --> 00:15:59.967
You know,
my father died alone.

00:16:01.176 --> 00:16:02.678
Hmm?

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:04.554
I couldn't be with him.
I was at medical school.

00:16:05.305 --> 00:16:07.182
But I wonder
what it was like...

00:16:08.809 --> 00:16:11.353
all alone, approaching death.

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:14.982
Um... I'll never forgive myself.

00:16:17.359 --> 00:16:18.318
I'm, uh...

00:16:19.027 --> 00:16:19.987
so sorry.

00:16:20.737 --> 00:16:21.780
Thank you.

00:16:22.322 --> 00:16:24.658
I'm, uh, D.W. Sabian,
Max. Uh...

00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:26.410
- Oh.
- I'm the doctor on staff.

00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:33.000
I'm sorry about all that.
It was a tad much, but, uh...

00:16:34.835 --> 00:16:36.628
It's just my way
of saying that...

00:16:37.587 --> 00:16:38.880
these are good people

00:16:39.548 --> 00:16:42.050
and they deserve comfort
in their twilight years.

00:16:48.265 --> 00:16:49.016
You have, uh...

00:16:50.017 --> 00:16:51.143
You have beautiful eyes.

00:16:52.394 --> 00:16:53.478
Quite large, you know?

00:16:55.355 --> 00:16:56.690
Thanks.

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:27.114
Did you like
what you saw yesterday?

00:18:28.657 --> 00:18:31.243
I wanna see you now.

00:18:31.326 --> 00:18:34.496
It's touching time.

00:19:57.787 --> 00:19:59.039
Max?

00:19:59.748 --> 00:20:02.209
Why are you awake
at this hour of the night?

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:04.336
You didn't...

00:20:05.587 --> 00:20:06.463
hear the...?

00:20:08.632 --> 00:20:11.384
Nothing. Nothing.
I just, uh...
I couldn't sleep.

00:20:11.468 --> 00:20:14.846
Oh, well...
That makes two of us.

00:20:15.889 --> 00:20:19.226
You know, sometimes
I find a little late-night
conversation can help.

00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:22.020
You interested?

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:24.606
Sure. Yeah.

00:20:25.482 --> 00:20:26.483
Good.

00:20:26.566 --> 00:20:27.609
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

00:20:32.155 --> 00:20:33.823
Wow.

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:35.242
- Very nice.
- Mm-hmm.

00:20:40.288 --> 00:20:42.916
Oh, um, I think
you dropped something.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.709
Oh...

00:20:46.836 --> 00:20:48.129
This looks familiar. Where...

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:49.923
Where have I seen this before?

00:20:50.006 --> 00:20:51.383
My friend, Esther...

00:20:51.466 --> 00:20:54.344
She passed away here
some years ago.

00:20:54.427 --> 00:20:57.264
She would sculpt trinkets
for people.

00:20:58.848 --> 00:21:01.268
I have a hard time
letting go of such things.

00:21:06.356 --> 00:21:08.984
I'm guessing, uh,
that's another one
of those things?

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:10.151
At least half of it.

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:12.404
Oh, my son, Jacob.

00:21:12.487 --> 00:21:15.782
He... he painted that for me
one Mother's Day.

00:21:15.865 --> 00:21:18.994
There used to be
a flock of birds
on the other side,

00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:21.121
with the sun rising above it.

00:21:22.455 --> 00:21:24.791
Then we...
We had a fight one night,

00:21:24.874 --> 00:21:26.459
and he ripped it up.

00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:28.753
He, um...

00:21:29.754 --> 00:21:30.714
He passed away

00:21:31.756 --> 00:21:32.924
some time ago.

00:21:33.633 --> 00:21:35.885
I'm... I'm sorry.
I-I didn't--

00:21:35.969 --> 00:21:37.304
No, no, it's all right.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.849
That's why
I can't sleep at night.

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:44.936
The un... unresolved
keeps me awake.

00:21:46.771 --> 00:21:47.647
What about you?

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:51.484
Kind of like
the same thing.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.071
Mmm.

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:22.223
Well, if you slow down
a little...

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:24.893
So, mirror acting
is about mimicking.

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:27.270
Okay. One, two, three.

00:22:27.354 --> 00:22:28.813
Hey!

00:22:28.897 --> 00:22:30.899
All right. All right.

00:22:30.982 --> 00:22:33.318
Get out of here. Go to lunch.
I know you're hungry.

00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:35.612
This is terrific.
You're turning
into great actors.

00:22:35.695 --> 00:22:36.905
You know that? It's amazing.

00:22:36.988 --> 00:22:38.615
Keep at it, all right?

00:22:38.698 --> 00:22:39.699
Ah!

00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:42.994
Lou, that looked like
a lot of fun.

00:22:43.078 --> 00:22:45.455
Max! Maxie boy!

00:22:45.538 --> 00:22:47.374
- Hey. Good morning.
- Morning.

00:22:47.457 --> 00:22:50.043
Yeah, I'm trying--
I am trying to impart

00:22:50.126 --> 00:22:52.253
some nuggets of wisdom

00:22:52.337 --> 00:22:56.257
I learned
on my off-Broadway
theater days.

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:59.427
Not many Oliviers here,
but, uh...

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:01.930
we have a lot of fun
nonetheless.

00:23:02.013 --> 00:23:04.140
I think whatever
you're doing here is great.

00:23:04.224 --> 00:23:05.725
I mean, they seem
really happy.

00:23:05.809 --> 00:23:07.060
Oh, thanks.

00:23:07.852 --> 00:23:10.146
Thanks, Max. I...

00:23:11.815 --> 00:23:14.859
You know, people spend
their entire lives

00:23:15.944 --> 00:23:17.987
trying to prolong life.

00:23:18.071 --> 00:23:21.282
But then when they get here
at the end, I mean,

00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:23.993
boredom is what takes them
to the grave.

00:23:24.077 --> 00:23:26.413
It's not disease.
It's not illness.

00:23:27.622 --> 00:23:28.540
It's boredom.

00:23:29.999 --> 00:23:34.879
We must fill our hours
with laughter, life...

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:37.465
love.

00:23:38.633 --> 00:23:40.301
Morning, Max.

00:23:40.385 --> 00:23:42.095
We got a spill on three.
You're needed.

00:23:42.846 --> 00:23:43.930
- Ah.
- I...

00:23:44.013 --> 00:23:45.598
Needed.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.725
And, hey, fuck boredom.

00:24:52.332 --> 00:24:54.501
...that they're going
to find oil.

00:24:54.584 --> 00:24:57.670
Matter of fact,
in exploratory drilling,

00:24:57.754 --> 00:25:01.299
only one well in nine
finds any oil at all.

00:25:01.382 --> 00:25:06.179
Only one in 24
recovers enough oil
to pay for itself.

00:25:06.262 --> 00:25:10.767
And only one
in almost a thousand
makes a major discovery.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.560
Pretty big odds.

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:14.604
Yet America's fuel reserves

00:25:14.687 --> 00:25:17.273
the oil supplies
still underground

00:25:17.357 --> 00:25:19.526
have kept increasing steadily.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.237
I couldn't imagine

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.571
how this ever-increasing

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:26.032
supply of oil was achieved

00:25:26.115 --> 00:25:28.993
until I found out
that there's not just one,

00:25:29.077 --> 00:25:31.287
- but thousands
of oil companies...

00:25:31.371 --> 00:25:32.872
...all competing
with each other

00:25:32.956 --> 00:25:36.501
to discover and to sell
new sources of oil.

00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:41.089
Or believe it or not,
in the USA, anyone...

00:25:44.092 --> 00:25:46.469
Hey. Hey, man, it's all right.

00:25:46.553 --> 00:25:48.179
I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:25:55.103 --> 00:25:56.688
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:26:03.778 --> 00:26:05.780
Stop!

00:26:05.863 --> 00:26:06.906
Jesus!

00:26:07.949 --> 00:26:09.242
Juno.

00:26:09.325 --> 00:26:10.743
What the hell
are you doing?

00:26:10.827 --> 00:26:13.079
Max, get your fucking hands
off him!

00:26:15.331 --> 00:26:19.085
Go! Max, go! Get out!

00:26:31.848 --> 00:26:34.601
Hey, Max. Uh,
you wanna come in, please?

00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:37.604
Come on in.

00:26:39.147 --> 00:26:42.150
Les takes his job
very seriously, and...

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:44.611
he's not very happy about this.

00:26:45.403 --> 00:26:48.156
And to be frank, neither am I.

00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:49.782
Um, uh...

00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:52.660
- I just-- I heard a scream.
- Mm-hmm.

00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:55.788
And, uh, I-I went
to go check it out.

00:26:55.872 --> 00:26:58.333
All right. But you told Les
that there was an unlocked door

00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:00.209
that accessed the fourth floor.

00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:04.964
You know, Max,
we're very aware
of why you're here.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.427
This should be
a fresh start for you.

00:27:10.386 --> 00:27:13.765
A chance to shed the skin
of your past transgressions.

00:27:15.183 --> 00:27:19.020
I would hate to see you return
to your reckless ways.

00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:22.774
It's time to play
by the rules, Max.

00:27:23.691 --> 00:27:26.653
I'm sorry, Doc.
It won't happen again.

00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:57.975
Hey, Max.

00:27:58.059 --> 00:27:59.560
Norma. Hi.

00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:01.437
How's it going?
Why aren't you in the party?

00:28:01.521 --> 00:28:04.691
Oh, I'm not in the party mood.

00:28:06.401 --> 00:28:08.528
I hear you were up on four.

00:28:09.737 --> 00:28:12.657
Word travels fast
in an old age home, Max.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.160
It's like a gigantic
sewing circle.

00:28:17.161 --> 00:28:18.705
Those people on four,

00:28:19.455 --> 00:28:21.332
there's something wrong.

00:28:21.416 --> 00:28:24.252
Like, they seem so lost.

00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:27.296
- And their eyes,
they're just...
- Oh, Max.

00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:30.925
"A heart knows a heart."

00:28:31.926 --> 00:28:32.719
Hmm?

00:28:34.095 --> 00:28:36.764
When I'd, uh, put my son
to bed at night,

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:39.684
I'd kiss him and say,
"A heart knows a heart."

00:28:40.768 --> 00:28:43.396
That's why you feel things
the way you do.

00:28:43.479 --> 00:28:44.480
But...

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.191
you need to put that away.

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:49.861
There's nothing
you can do for them.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.741
There's nothing...

00:28:56.325 --> 00:28:57.827
nothing anyone can do.

00:29:11.174 --> 00:29:14.427
...all oil lies far beneath
the surface of the earth.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.637
They're going to find oil.

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:19.515
These wells go down
thousands of feet.

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:21.434
It costs a lot of money
to drill.

00:29:21.517 --> 00:29:25.813
But that's no guarantee
that they're going to find oil.

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:28.775
Matter of fact,
in exploratory drilling,

00:29:28.858 --> 00:29:32.361
only one well in nine
finds any oil at all.

00:29:32.445 --> 00:29:37.200
Only one in 24
recovers enough oil
to pay for itself.

00:29:37.283 --> 00:29:41.704
And only one
in almost a thousand
makes a major discovery.

00:29:41.788 --> 00:29:43.498
Pretty big odds.

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:45.792
Yet America's fuel reserves

00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:48.085
the oil supplies
still underground...

00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:49.712
Hey, man,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.569
I'm not doing
very well at this game,
but I am not a quitter.

00:30:16.405 --> 00:30:17.824
Hey! Did you see?

00:30:19.242 --> 00:30:20.284
Oh, my God.

00:30:21.369 --> 00:30:22.578
You look downright awful.

00:30:23.287 --> 00:30:25.331
Well, thanks.

00:30:25.414 --> 00:30:27.500
And, yeah, I mean...

00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:30.211
I look how I feel.
I haven't been able
to sleep at all here.

00:30:30.294 --> 00:30:33.005
Okay. You know,
rumor has it

00:30:33.089 --> 00:30:38.219
that they mess
with the oxygen levels
in the... in the vents,

00:30:38.302 --> 00:30:40.346
but it's just to make sure
that us old folks

00:30:40.429 --> 00:30:41.973
get a good night's sleep, huh.

00:30:42.056 --> 00:30:44.433
I mean, it must work
'cause I sleep like death.

00:30:44.517 --> 00:30:47.311
You cannot wake me up
once I go under.

00:30:57.446 --> 00:30:59.490
Norma, enough!

00:31:05.746 --> 00:31:07.623
Don't touch me!

00:31:11.294 --> 00:31:12.044
Don't!

00:31:14.255 --> 00:31:16.841
Okay, I'm feeling good
now, guys, so rack 'em up.

00:31:16.924 --> 00:31:19.427
Who am I hustling next, huh?

00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:22.847
Norma. Norma, it's Max.

00:31:26.309 --> 00:31:28.644
Um...

00:31:29.186 --> 00:31:33.441
Lou plans these
murder mystery nights
once a month.

00:31:33.524 --> 00:31:37.069
"A night of blood and intrigue,"
as he puts it.

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:41.282
I just wanted to check on you
because I saw you arguing
with someone.

00:31:41.365 --> 00:31:43.242
- I just...
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's-- that's...

00:31:43.326 --> 00:31:44.577
It's fine.

00:31:46.203 --> 00:31:49.290
Well, I won't take too much
of your time. I, uh...

00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:52.835
I was just thinking about
what you told me the other day,

00:31:52.919 --> 00:31:56.714
and I thought
it would only be fair
if I return the favor.

00:31:57.381 --> 00:31:59.759
Um... you see,

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:04.889
my brother Luke died
when I was 11,

00:32:04.972 --> 00:32:06.933
and my parents...

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.685
didn't let me go
to the funeral

00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:11.062
'cause they thought
I was too young,

00:32:11.145 --> 00:32:12.313
so I never...

00:32:13.522 --> 00:32:15.316
I never got the chance
to say goodbye.

00:32:17.318 --> 00:32:19.695
Luke is my unresolved.

00:32:21.697 --> 00:32:24.241
Anyway, I was just thinking
about yesterday,

00:32:24.325 --> 00:32:26.994
so I just, uh...
drew this up

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:29.956
'cause I just thought
you should have it.

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:38.714
I tried to get it exactly right,
but I think it'll... it'll do.

00:32:38.798 --> 00:32:39.966
Oh!

00:32:45.972 --> 00:32:46.973
Oh.

00:32:51.227 --> 00:32:53.312
- "A heart knows a heart."
- "...knows a heart."

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:00.987
- Max.
- Yeah?

00:33:03.739 --> 00:33:04.991
Listen to me.

00:33:07.076 --> 00:33:11.038
There's something very wrong
with this place.

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:13.708
Something terribly wrong.

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:15.751
You need to get...

00:33:15.835 --> 00:33:16.877
...out of--

00:33:20.381 --> 00:33:21.215
I have to go.

00:33:22.675 --> 00:33:24.301
What? You have to tell me
what's going on.

00:33:24.385 --> 00:33:26.721
Max, I have to get ready.
I can't be late.

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:29.306
- Norma. What the fuck?
- Forget it, Max.
We'll talk tomorrow.

00:33:39.859 --> 00:33:41.360
"There's something wrong
with this place."

00:33:41.444 --> 00:33:42.778
What the fuck does that mean?

00:33:46.073 --> 00:33:47.825
What the fuck's wrong
with this place?

00:33:50.786 --> 00:33:53.164
Hey, have you seen Norma?

00:33:53.247 --> 00:33:55.207
Is she still at that, like,
murder mystery thing?

00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:57.877
Oh, no, baby.
We took her to the infirmary.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.295
She wasn't feeling well.

00:34:00.129 --> 00:34:02.131
What-- what happened?
Is she all right?

00:34:02.673 --> 00:34:05.926
It's her diabetes.
Her blood sugar
was really low.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.512
You know, it makes her
kind of loopy.

00:34:08.596 --> 00:34:11.307
She's sleeping now.
We're gonna monitor her
overnight.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.560
She'll be fine, Max.

00:34:14.643 --> 00:34:16.062
Relax.

00:34:18.022 --> 00:34:20.066
Well, tell her I said "hi"
if you can.

00:34:23.319 --> 00:34:24.528
Night.

00:34:24.612 --> 00:34:26.072
Sleep tight, Max.

00:35:25.714 --> 00:35:27.299
Oh, my God!

00:35:27.383 --> 00:35:28.134
Norma!

00:35:28.968 --> 00:35:29.969
Norma!

00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:52.533
Officer, I found this note
in Norma's room.

00:35:52.616 --> 00:35:55.369
She speaks about joining
her deceased son.

00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:05.129
I'm sorry, Max.

00:36:05.754 --> 00:36:07.214
We just didn't see this coming.

00:36:45.753 --> 00:36:47.755
Mind if I, uh,
take a seat, Lou?

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:49.048
Oh, no.

00:36:53.636 --> 00:36:54.470
How you holding up?

00:36:55.512 --> 00:36:56.430
Oh...

00:36:58.098 --> 00:37:00.351
She could no longer
fill the hours

00:37:01.268 --> 00:37:04.855
with... laughter
and joy and...

00:37:07.775 --> 00:37:09.944
I failed her, Max.

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:12.446
No. She was my muse,
you know?

00:37:12.988 --> 00:37:14.531
She'd help with my diet.

00:37:14.615 --> 00:37:17.159
Said, "You have to stay
in shape, Louis.

00:37:17.243 --> 00:37:19.411
Just in case
another wonderful role

00:37:19.495 --> 00:37:21.247
comes your way."

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:23.540
And in return,

00:37:24.667 --> 00:37:27.920
I'd recite
Shakespeare's sonnets
to help her sleep.

00:37:28.003 --> 00:37:29.255
I can't...

00:37:30.631 --> 00:37:32.424
Do you really think
that she would...

00:37:33.759 --> 00:37:35.219
take her own life?

00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:40.891
Well, I don't know, Max. I...

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.272
Where's this coming from, son?

00:37:47.439 --> 00:37:50.943
Well... it's just Norma said
something to me.

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:54.446
She said that
there was something wrong
with this place.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.324
Something very wrong.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.035
And then the next day,
she just...

00:38:07.876 --> 00:38:10.212
Lou. Hey!

00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:17.928
Hey.

00:38:20.973 --> 00:38:24.560
Oh, I went away again,
didn't I?

00:38:28.063 --> 00:38:30.316
Yeah. Oh, God.
It's happening more often,

00:38:30.941 --> 00:38:32.318
and more often.

00:38:41.994 --> 00:38:44.121
Hey, Max.

00:39:02.264 --> 00:39:03.307
Help me!

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:09.660
We haven't heard
from you, Max. Are you okay?

00:42:09.743 --> 00:42:11.453
Sorry. Yeah. The, uh...

00:42:11.537 --> 00:42:12.871
One of the residents
passed away,

00:42:12.955 --> 00:42:14.039
and it was really sad,

00:42:14.122 --> 00:42:15.499
but I'm okay now.

00:42:15.582 --> 00:42:17.918
Oh, my God.
Are you eating, Max?

00:42:18.001 --> 00:42:19.920
You look tired.
You need to eat.

00:42:20.003 --> 00:42:22.506
He knows eating is important,
Sylvia, for God's sakes.

00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:24.383
I'm glad to hear
you're feeling better
today, Max.

00:42:24.466 --> 00:42:26.426
- Mmm.
- You had us worried.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.554
Let me ask you this.

00:42:28.637 --> 00:42:31.181
Are you getting anything
out of this experience?

00:42:31.265 --> 00:42:33.225
You know, I-I actually am.

00:42:33.308 --> 00:42:36.186
You know, I, uh... I think
these people need me and...

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.188
I think I can help them.

00:42:38.272 --> 00:42:40.023
I have to help them.

00:42:45.612 --> 00:42:46.697
Morning, Max.

00:42:54.413 --> 00:42:55.414
Fuck.

00:43:51.803 --> 00:43:53.305
Jesus Christ.

00:43:53.388 --> 00:43:55.182
What the fuck you doing?

00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:57.100
That yellow tape
look like a welcome mat?

00:43:57.184 --> 00:43:58.393
- No, I--
- Hey.

00:43:59.603 --> 00:44:01.480
You just cannot help
yourself, can you?

00:44:02.689 --> 00:44:04.316
Let's go.
I gotta tell the doc.

00:44:04.399 --> 00:44:06.360
He calls the cops this time,
and that's on you.

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:08.820
I just came back
to say goodbye. Okay?

00:44:08.904 --> 00:44:11.490
I... wanted to look around,
see if I can find something

00:44:11.573 --> 00:44:13.158
to remember her by.

00:44:13.241 --> 00:44:15.661
Her shit is all gone already.
It's thrown out.

00:44:16.244 --> 00:44:17.913
She had no family.

00:44:17.996 --> 00:44:20.415
Whatever's left
gets incinerated
in the basement.

00:44:20.499 --> 00:44:21.667
It's over.

00:44:26.463 --> 00:44:27.464
I-I...

00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:29.675
I get it, Max.

00:44:31.885 --> 00:44:32.844
But you owe me.

00:44:34.137 --> 00:44:35.847
Get out before
I change my mind.

00:44:37.516 --> 00:44:38.684
Thank you. Thanks, Les.

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:57.053
Come on, Norma.

00:45:57.137 --> 00:45:58.764
There's gotta be
something in here.

00:46:07.439 --> 00:46:09.691
Max had an encounter
on the fourth floor.

00:46:09.775 --> 00:46:11.818
He needs to know the danger.

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:13.069
Am I next?

00:46:13.153 --> 00:46:15.071
Is my Lou next?

00:46:15.155 --> 00:46:18.700
They come at night
with their needles
and their dogs,

00:46:18.784 --> 00:46:20.786
changing us too.

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:30.253
Lou!

00:46:32.464 --> 00:46:34.090
Lou, I gotta talk to you.
You in there?

00:46:34.174 --> 00:46:35.425
Can't talk.

00:46:37.385 --> 00:46:38.929
Oh!

00:46:39.012 --> 00:46:41.306
Lou, thank God you're here.

00:46:41.389 --> 00:46:43.975
Norma was right, man.
There's something
fucking wrong with this place.

00:46:44.059 --> 00:46:46.186
And... and I found her diary.

00:46:46.269 --> 00:46:48.355
She says there's
something going on at night
with, like, needles.

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:49.773
Gluttony...

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:53.693
- kills more than the sword.
- Lou, what?

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:54.861
Bet you didn't know that,
did you?

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:57.113
What?

00:46:57.197 --> 00:47:00.575
She always protected me
against my demons.

00:47:00.659 --> 00:47:02.160
Oh, my Norma...

00:47:02.244 --> 00:47:04.412
And she's gone!

00:47:05.038 --> 00:47:08.500
And I'm weak!
I'm so fucking weak!

00:47:09.543 --> 00:47:11.169
I have to punish myself.

00:47:12.546 --> 00:47:14.548
Can you not hear me?

00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:15.924
What the fuck?

00:47:16.007 --> 00:47:17.592
I am a pig!

00:47:17.676 --> 00:47:19.427
- Lou!
- I ruined my career.

00:47:19.511 --> 00:47:21.471
I did it, so I must be punished!

00:47:21.555 --> 00:47:22.889
I'm a pig!

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:26.184
Mmm! Mmm!
I have something
for you, Max.

00:47:26.268 --> 00:47:28.478
Look at that.

00:47:28.562 --> 00:47:30.772
- Oh, my-- What the fuck?
- Oh, yes, and they all
have to come out.

00:47:30.856 --> 00:47:32.691
- What the fuck?
- You have to help me, Max.

00:47:32.774 --> 00:47:34.568
- I want you to help me.
- Stop! Lou!

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:36.027
- Lou, put--
- I have to get them all!

00:47:36.111 --> 00:47:37.612
- I have to do this!
- Will somebody please help?

00:47:37.696 --> 00:47:41.241
Pliers! Give me my pliers!

00:47:41.324 --> 00:47:43.910
- Ahh!
- Will somebody
fucking help me please?

00:49:04.199 --> 00:49:05.700
Fuck.

00:50:16.855 --> 00:50:20.066
Max. Max!

00:50:20.692 --> 00:50:23.194
Max, someone's coming.
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

00:50:32.245 --> 00:50:33.705
Good morning. Hey.

00:50:34.372 --> 00:50:35.248
You okay?

00:50:36.041 --> 00:50:37.333
You looked flushed.

00:50:37.417 --> 00:50:39.502
Yeah, I'm-- I'm fine.
What's going on?

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.589
Well, I just wanted to stop by
and let you know

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:44.340
that Lou is gonna be fine.

00:50:44.966 --> 00:50:46.801
I know you were concerned
about him.

00:50:46.885 --> 00:50:48.595
That's... that's great.
Thank you.

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:49.804
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.057
You get anything good?

00:50:54.476 --> 00:50:56.561
I love it when my smiles arrive.

00:50:56.644 --> 00:50:58.688
You know, I can't really
sleep here, so I just...

00:50:58.772 --> 00:51:00.440
I just got some books.

00:51:00.523 --> 00:51:03.777
Mmm. You don't strike me
as a reader.

00:51:03.818 --> 00:51:06.071
But, okay, let's get to work.

00:51:06.154 --> 00:51:08.031
- First floor. Five minutes.
- Thank you.
I'll be right there.

00:51:08.114 --> 00:51:09.532
- Okay.
- Don't make me come back.

00:51:13.536 --> 00:51:15.163
Hello? Hello? Are you there?

00:51:15.246 --> 00:51:16.414
Please? Is someone there?

00:51:20.251 --> 00:51:22.253
Max, thank God you're here.

00:51:22.337 --> 00:51:24.672
Who are you? How'd you know
someone was coming to my room?

00:51:24.756 --> 00:51:26.257
I've been watching you.

00:51:26.341 --> 00:51:27.634
Did you put
the black light in here?

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.385
Yes. I needed you to find out.

00:51:29.469 --> 00:51:31.179
What the fuck
do you want from me? Why?

00:51:31.262 --> 00:51:33.181
I can't say more.
If I'm gone too long,

00:51:33.264 --> 00:51:35.100
they'll grow suspicious.

00:51:35.183 --> 00:51:37.268
- They'll hurt me.
- Who's gonna hurt you?
Who? Sabian?

00:51:37.352 --> 00:51:39.229
This is so much bigger
than you think.

00:51:39.312 --> 00:51:41.022
But I can't answer any more
of your questions right now.

00:51:41.106 --> 00:51:43.274
No, wait!
Just tell me something--

00:51:43.358 --> 00:51:45.610
Help me help them, Max.

00:51:45.693 --> 00:51:47.862
Help me help them

00:51:47.946 --> 00:51:50.782
before they're all turned
into monsters
just like the others.

00:51:50.865 --> 00:51:52.826
We have to stop them, Max.

00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:54.953
They killed Norma
for knowing too much.

00:51:55.036 --> 00:51:56.246
They'll kill you too.

00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:57.789
They'll kill you too.

00:51:57.872 --> 00:51:59.165
They'll kill you too.

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:00.875
Kill you too... Kill you too...

00:52:00.959 --> 00:52:02.168
Kill you...

00:52:03.962 --> 00:52:05.088
Hello?

00:52:11.219 --> 00:52:12.512
Storms of Greta's magnitude

00:52:12.595 --> 00:52:14.973
are a direct result
of global warming,

00:52:15.056 --> 00:52:18.393
'cause your generation
raped this planet,
depleted it of its resources.

00:52:18.476 --> 00:52:21.855
You had to have everything,
no matter the cost.

00:52:21.938 --> 00:52:25.275
You have no real proof
establishing mankind's
responsibility

00:52:25.358 --> 00:52:28.486
for this small amount
of the crazy word--

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:30.446
That's trying to advance
your own agenda.

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:31.865
My agenda is simple.

00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.575
Saving the environment.

00:52:34.617 --> 00:52:37.662
Normal climate change
is natural.
The Earth's climate--

00:52:37.745 --> 00:52:39.205
We're inheriting
a dying world.

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:41.416
A world that is withering away.

00:52:41.499 --> 00:52:43.251
- The liberal agenda--
- Clearly,

00:52:43.334 --> 00:52:45.587
climate change
is a hotly debated topic.

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:48.965
There are naysayers,
but the scientific consensus
is clear

00:52:49.048 --> 00:52:52.135
that the Earth's temperature
is increasing daily...

00:53:16.492 --> 00:53:18.703
Climate change
is a bunch of bullshit.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.220
Max.

00:53:36.679 --> 00:53:38.723
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

00:53:38.806 --> 00:53:41.309
- Are you okay?
- No, I look terrible,
but I'm okay.

00:53:41.392 --> 00:53:43.519
I do-- I want you
to know I...

00:53:43.603 --> 00:53:46.064
I'm so sorry
you had to see
all that last night.

00:53:46.147 --> 00:53:47.690
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

00:53:47.774 --> 00:53:49.609
Oh, no. Oh, no. Max.

00:53:50.276 --> 00:53:53.029
There's-- there's something
very wrong with me.

00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:56.157
I fear I'm about to disappear.

00:53:56.241 --> 00:53:58.159
- There's nothing wrong
with you.
- I'm gonna miss you.

00:53:58.243 --> 00:53:59.744
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:53:59.827 --> 00:54:01.246
It's this place.

00:54:01.746 --> 00:54:02.914
Norma...

00:54:02.997 --> 00:54:04.457
She was right about you.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.627
You are one of the good ones.

00:55:02.056 --> 00:55:04.058
Sick. It's like Predator.

00:55:29.375 --> 00:55:30.335
What are you doing?

00:55:46.142 --> 00:55:47.560
What the fuck you got, old man?

00:55:51.606 --> 00:55:53.149
Where the fuck is he going?

00:55:53.649 --> 00:55:54.525
Fuck.

00:56:58.047 --> 00:56:59.424
Wait, is it all of them?

00:57:29.912 --> 00:57:31.038
Ah, fuck this.

00:58:02.862 --> 00:58:05.364
- Sit down and shut the fuck up!
- - No!

00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:07.116
- No!
- You shut up!

00:58:13.915 --> 00:58:16.334
No. No! No!

00:58:22.924 --> 00:58:24.217
No! No!

00:58:47.323 --> 00:58:49.283
Help me help them, Max.

00:58:49.367 --> 00:58:50.368
It's you.

00:58:50.451 --> 00:58:51.994
You need to tell me who you are

00:58:52.078 --> 00:58:53.621
and what the fuck is going on
right now, please.

00:58:53.704 --> 00:58:55.081
Hold on. Just let me
show you something.

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:56.457
Give me one minute.

00:58:56.541 --> 00:58:57.917
That's all I ask.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.293
Yeah.

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.338
Read the letterhead.

00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:05.508
Almont is a subsidiary

00:59:05.591 --> 00:59:08.094
of the US Department
of Health Services.

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:09.637
Right. What the fuck
does that mean?

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.430
It means that the government

00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:14.016
is funding this entire facility.

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.310
Research, testing,
new experimental drugs,

00:59:16.394 --> 00:59:18.396
controversial gene trials.

00:59:18.479 --> 00:59:20.231
Any outlandish
or fucked up idea

00:59:20.314 --> 00:59:22.191
the government has,
they first test on animals,

00:59:22.275 --> 00:59:24.110
then on people.

00:59:24.986 --> 00:59:26.737
- Old people?
- Yes.

00:59:26.821 --> 00:59:29.198
And the government
has facilities just like this

00:59:29.282 --> 00:59:30.783
all across the country.

00:59:31.409 --> 00:59:32.743
They are experimenting
on hundreds,

00:59:32.827 --> 00:59:35.329
if not thousands
of elderly people.

00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:37.873
They're the perfect
test subjects

00:59:38.958 --> 00:59:42.003
'cause if they get dementia,
nobody thinks anything
'cause they're old.

00:59:42.086 --> 00:59:44.463
And if they die,
nobody gives a fuck
'cause they're old.

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:46.966
So what you are doing
is important,

00:59:47.049 --> 00:59:48.676
which is why
you cannot stop now.

00:59:48.759 --> 00:59:51.220
Who are you
and why do you even care?

00:59:51.304 --> 00:59:52.597
My father...

00:59:53.848 --> 00:59:55.474
lived in a room down the hall.

00:59:58.728 --> 01:00:00.354
Now he's on the fourth floor.

01:00:03.316 --> 01:00:04.817
Please keep going

01:00:05.943 --> 01:00:07.486
'cause we need evidence.

01:00:08.446 --> 01:00:11.782
If we expose them,
then maybe
it will help my father

01:00:13.075 --> 01:00:14.160
and your friends.

01:00:15.703 --> 01:00:17.580
I need to leave.
I've been here
long enough already.

01:00:17.663 --> 01:00:19.874
- Wait.
- Don't follow me.

01:00:39.393 --> 01:00:40.519
Hi, Max.

01:00:41.228 --> 01:00:43.189
I'm gonna give you
an examination now.

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.315
You know what?

01:00:44.398 --> 01:00:45.608
Sometimes,

01:00:45.691 --> 01:00:48.194
when things are bad
on the outside,

01:00:48.861 --> 01:00:50.488
we have to look on the inside.

01:00:53.199 --> 01:00:55.326
Look at that. Look,
I got a lot of blood.

01:00:55.409 --> 01:00:56.994
You're wasting your youth.

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:06.420
It's touching time.

01:01:06.504 --> 01:01:07.588
They will kill...

01:01:07.672 --> 01:01:09.173
They'll kill you!

01:01:12.343 --> 01:01:13.511
They'll kill you too.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.347
Dea!

01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:18.766
It's very rare to see storms
of this magnitude

01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:20.851
threatening the East Coast
at this time of year.

01:01:20.935 --> 01:01:23.562
You hear this
boogeyman bullshit, Max?

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.731
Global warming hype.
That's all it is.

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:27.733
Just wanna sell you
more milk and bread.

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.402
Agh. Did they fucking mark me?

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.529
- This shit is crazy.
- What the fuck did they do?

01:01:31.612 --> 01:01:33.072
You took quite a fall, Max.

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:36.617
Your vitals
were all over the place.

01:01:36.701 --> 01:01:37.702
What happened?

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:39.495
Patient from four...

01:01:40.287 --> 01:01:41.706
somehow got loose.

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:43.958
Les is looking into it.

01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:46.752
But I'll tell you
what's for sure.

01:01:48.087 --> 01:01:49.880
He definitely meant you
some harm.

01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:54.051
Dr. Sabian wants to do
a very thorough exam today.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.053
You're in good hands.

01:01:58.097 --> 01:02:00.015
I'll go and let the doc know
you're awake

01:02:00.099 --> 01:02:01.517
so we can get started.

01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:16.907
"Examine" my fucking ass.

01:02:43.225 --> 01:02:44.977
Another one of your messes, Max.

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.437
I'm sure the cops will be here
as soon as you've broken

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.521
the terms of your deal.

01:02:47.605 --> 01:02:49.231
What, are you on drugs?

01:02:49.315 --> 01:02:51.317
No, I was just trying to help,
I swear. I'm sorry.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.818
Sweetheart,
you're safe here.

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:55.321
All right, I'm gonna make
some calls.

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.323
Oh, girls. Hi.

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.408
Oh, Maxie, these are
your foster sisters.

01:02:59.492 --> 01:03:01.327
This is Tessa and Jackie.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.330
Maxie is not feeling well,
and he's gonna stay
in his old room.

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.040
Okay? Stay put, sweetie.

01:03:07.374 --> 01:03:08.918
Honey, you are always-- Oh!

01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:11.587
Sweetheart, you're always
on a crusade.

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:14.423
Stay there, girls.

01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:26.143
Hi.

01:03:26.227 --> 01:03:27.937
You were sleeping a long time.

01:03:33.275 --> 01:03:34.777
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:36.070
Thanks for, um...

01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:39.573
Thanks for letting me stay here
and taking care of me.

01:03:39.657 --> 01:03:42.076
Maxie, you were just
trying to do the right thing.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.832
"A heart knows a heart."

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:54.880
What? What's that?
What's wrong?

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:58.926
Nothing, uh...

01:03:59.009 --> 01:04:00.553
Sorry. What...

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:02.304
What did... what did you say?

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.307
"A heart knows a heart."

01:04:05.391 --> 01:04:07.893
It's something a friend
once said to me a long time ago.

01:04:09.311 --> 01:04:10.521
Friend... a friend?

01:04:10.604 --> 01:04:11.689
Yeah.

01:04:13.607 --> 01:04:15.943
Ah, it's so funny.
I can't remember who.

01:04:16.861 --> 01:04:19.238
But it reminds me of you.

01:04:20.447 --> 01:04:22.283
Just trying to help
those good people.

01:04:25.703 --> 01:04:27.413
Oh, Maxie,
you look so tired.

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:28.789
I'm gonna go.

01:04:28.873 --> 01:04:31.375
Oh, Daddy said
maybe we should go

01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:33.168
to see Judge Beric.

01:04:33.252 --> 01:04:35.004
He might be able to help us.

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:37.882
Don't you fret.

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:41.677
You're my favorite.

01:05:10.372 --> 01:05:12.374
Hey. Hey, girls.

01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:15.586
Have you girls seen
this lady ever, huh?

01:05:15.669 --> 01:05:17.504
- No.
- What about Mom? Mom know her?

01:05:19.798 --> 01:05:21.383
- You never seen her before?
- No, never.

01:05:21.467 --> 01:05:22.593
Somebody knows.

01:05:48.327 --> 01:05:50.287
Are you okay?

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.915
You know what, girls?

01:05:52.998 --> 01:05:54.500
I'm really not feeling
too great today,

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:56.335
so if you could just give me
some space...

01:05:56.418 --> 01:05:57.753
Did you find the secret place?

01:05:57.836 --> 01:06:00.214
What? No, no,
I didn't find anything.

01:06:00.297 --> 01:06:02.758
Look, I'm having
a really bad day, okay?

01:06:02.841 --> 01:06:04.009
And I'm not in the mood
for a game.

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:05.761
We thought you found that

01:06:06.512 --> 01:06:07.429
in the secret place.

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:11.225
It's exactly the same.

01:06:13.227 --> 01:06:15.270
What do you mean,
"It's exactly the same"?
What's the secret place?

01:06:15.354 --> 01:06:16.772
What--
what are you talking about?

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:18.983
Can you keep a secret?

01:06:45.092 --> 01:06:47.011
We found this place
a couple of months ago.

01:07:06.613 --> 01:07:10.034
See, that one there
is exactly the same
as the one you had.

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:22.087
"Dea. Roman goddess of youth.

01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:23.672
Sip from her chalice."

01:07:25.507 --> 01:07:26.717
Do you know what this is?

01:07:27.801 --> 01:07:30.220
Have you ever heard of Dea?

01:07:30.304 --> 01:07:31.055
No.

01:07:37.311 --> 01:07:39.813
There's some stuff in there too.

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.066
Some old photos.

01:08:53.971 --> 01:08:56.098
Oh, my God. Luke.

01:09:10.571 --> 01:09:11.738
Are you okay?

01:09:13.157 --> 01:09:15.033
Max, are you okay?

01:09:15.909 --> 01:09:17.161
Who's Luke?

01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:23.542
Bye, Max.

01:10:15.219 --> 01:10:17.054
Hey.

01:10:17.137 --> 01:10:18.096
Luke.

01:10:19.765 --> 01:10:20.724
It's you, isn't it?

01:10:20.807 --> 01:10:22.267
Yeah...

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:23.560
My brother.

01:10:25.687 --> 01:10:26.688
My big brother.

01:10:28.273 --> 01:10:30.651
- Max...
- I missed you so much, Luke.

01:10:30.734 --> 01:10:32.236
Max...

01:10:34.071 --> 01:10:35.906
- You were just trying to help.
- Yeah.

01:10:35.989 --> 01:10:38.367
You were just trying to help.
Hey, look. Hey.

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:40.994
Check this out.

01:10:43.247 --> 01:10:44.248
Remember?

01:10:53.715 --> 01:10:55.884
Always. Always.

01:10:56.969 --> 01:10:59.846
Always. I never forgot you.

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:01.348
Okay, you gotta
help me now. Okay?

01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:02.474
So I can help you.

01:11:03.183 --> 01:11:04.142
Look...

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:07.271
I don't understand any of this.

01:11:07.354 --> 01:11:09.731
Is this where you were working
while you were at college?

01:11:09.815 --> 01:11:11.608
Is this where you were
when they said
you killed yourself?

01:11:12.859 --> 01:11:15.028
Yeah? Who are these people?

01:11:16.446 --> 01:11:17.281
She...

01:11:18.532 --> 01:11:19.408
"She"? That's her?

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.035
Okay. Sit tight.

01:11:22.119 --> 01:11:23.245
Hey.

01:11:23.328 --> 01:11:24.538
Hey. Is this you?

01:11:25.664 --> 01:11:26.540
Is that you?

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.293
It is you.

01:11:30.002 --> 01:11:31.295
Is this all of you?

01:11:32.838 --> 01:11:33.964
It's all of you.

01:11:34.673 --> 01:11:37.509
What the fuck?
What the fuck is going on?

01:11:38.051 --> 01:11:39.678
What happened to you guys?
I don't understand.

01:11:39.761 --> 01:11:41.388
What is-- What? Ugh!

01:11:49.146 --> 01:11:50.522
Shut the fuck up.

01:11:57.195 --> 01:11:58.655
Wake up, Max.

01:12:01.908 --> 01:12:03.327
There he is.

01:12:04.786 --> 01:12:06.121
Say cheese, Max.

01:12:08.081 --> 01:12:09.458
Say cheese, Max.

01:12:12.085 --> 01:12:13.295
Big smile!

01:12:13.378 --> 01:12:14.838
Really big smile.

01:12:16.757 --> 01:12:18.342
On three, everyone.

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:21.345
One, two...

01:12:22.679 --> 01:12:23.889
...three!

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:27.184
Good job, Max.

01:12:27.267 --> 01:12:28.977
Max, good job.

01:12:30.937 --> 01:12:33.315
Hey, relax. Enjoy it.

01:12:33.398 --> 01:12:34.775
You're the guest of honor.

01:12:34.858 --> 01:12:36.485
Our protagonist.

01:12:36.568 --> 01:12:37.861
Nice job, Max.

01:12:37.944 --> 01:12:39.488
What the fuck?

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:45.369
Um, I... Can-- can I have
everybody's attention, please?

01:12:46.203 --> 01:12:47.371
I, um...

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:49.748
I wanna make a toast

01:12:49.831 --> 01:12:52.084
to every single one of you.

01:12:52.793 --> 01:12:55.337
I thank you from the bottom
of my heart.

01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:56.838
And bravo!

01:12:56.922 --> 01:12:58.840
Bravo!

01:12:58.924 --> 01:13:02.427
- Lou! Lou! Lou! Lou!
- Oh, no. Come on. No.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:05.138
Okay. Okay. Come on.
Come on. Come on now.

01:13:05.222 --> 01:13:08.266
All of you did amazing work.

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:09.476
I mean, look--
look at all of you.

01:13:09.559 --> 01:13:11.520
Dr. Sabian's wife,

01:13:12.062 --> 01:13:14.231
Gretchen,
our damsel in distress.

01:13:14.314 --> 01:13:16.483
You were just wonderful.

01:13:16.566 --> 01:13:20.779
And our antagonist
playing a sadistic doctor.

01:13:20.862 --> 01:13:23.323
- You're too kind.
- All right. Now,
our supporting people.

01:13:23.407 --> 01:13:25.951
- There's Sadie.
Sexy Sadie.
- Sadie!

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:27.869
There's Ethan and Ellie,

01:13:27.953 --> 01:13:30.038
who cannot keep their hands
off each other.

01:13:30.122 --> 01:13:33.458
And... Sylvia and Couper!

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.793
- Yeah!
- And...

01:13:35.752 --> 01:13:38.088
- Mom?
- ...Juno and Les.

01:13:38.171 --> 01:13:40.298
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.217
What the fuck is going on?

01:13:46.596 --> 01:13:48.682
We're-- we're having
a celebration, Max.

01:13:49.433 --> 01:13:52.519
We're-- we're patting ourselves
on our backs.

01:13:52.602 --> 01:13:54.312
For what we did.

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:57.065
For the story we created
and performed

01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:58.900
to have some fun with you.

01:13:58.984 --> 01:14:01.153
Like we do with all
the other kids
who come to our home.

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:02.654
- Yes.
- What? What story?

01:14:02.737 --> 01:14:05.699
The marks on our necks,
the government conspiracy,

01:14:05.782 --> 01:14:08.243
Faceless Fantasies,
my psychoses,

01:14:08.326 --> 01:14:11.413
all part of the grand tale
we concocted

01:14:11.496 --> 01:14:13.707
to fuck with you
for our entertainment

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:15.584
while you nourished us
at night.

01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:17.210
We did it for fun!

01:14:17.294 --> 01:14:19.337
Bravo!

01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:22.883
What the fuck
are you talking about, Lou?
I don't understand.

01:14:22.966 --> 01:14:24.843
I, um...

01:14:24.926 --> 01:14:28.346
Doctor, I-I think you should--
Might wanna take this question.

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:30.056
- That was great, Lou.
- Oh.

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.100
- You did a fantastic job.
- Thank you. Thank you...

01:14:32.184 --> 01:14:34.144
So, Max, um...

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:37.397
what Lou is getting to

01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:40.400
is that we like to play
with our food.

01:14:40.484 --> 01:14:44.613
You see, you're really here
because we need to drain you,
young man.

01:14:45.655 --> 01:14:48.867
To drain you of your essence.

01:14:50.827 --> 01:14:52.579
So thank you, Max.

01:14:52.662 --> 01:14:54.039
And thank you, Dea.

01:14:54.122 --> 01:14:55.957
Thank you, Dea.

01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:57.542
The God of youth.

01:14:58.877 --> 01:15:01.463
The God of... us.

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:04.633
Never shall we waste...

01:15:04.716 --> 01:15:07.052
- Dea.
- ...what she has provided...

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:08.678
- Thank you, Dea.
- Dea.

01:15:08.762 --> 01:15:11.973
- ...with love.
- Praise Dea! Praise Dea!

01:15:12.057 --> 01:15:14.434
- Dea!
- Dea!

01:15:14.518 --> 01:15:16.269
- Dea!
- Dea!

01:15:16.353 --> 01:15:17.437
Dea!

01:15:19.898 --> 01:15:22.067
- Dea!
- Dea, Dea, Dea, Dea, Dea...

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:23.193
Let me out!

01:15:24.361 --> 01:15:25.278
Dea!

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:43.713
Don't be afraid, Max.

01:15:43.797 --> 01:15:46.341
All you'll feel
is a little pinch

01:15:46.424 --> 01:15:49.261
as the needle
penetrates your eye.

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:51.930
You know about
the fountain of youth?
You've heard of that, right?

01:15:52.013 --> 01:15:54.516
It's real,
but it lives within us.

01:15:54.599 --> 01:15:57.435
There's a small sack
behind your right eye

01:15:57.519 --> 01:16:00.355
where Goddess Dea's
nectar resides.

01:16:00.438 --> 01:16:03.191
- Mm-hmm.
- Science dismisses it as just a gland.

01:16:03.275 --> 01:16:04.693
Idiots.

01:16:05.944 --> 01:16:08.572
But Dea showed us the truth.

01:16:08.655 --> 01:16:11.700
It's what gives a person
youth and vitality.

01:16:11.783 --> 01:16:16.871
So we take Dea's nectar from you

01:16:16.955 --> 01:16:19.749
- because ours
goes away with age.
- Oh!

01:16:19.833 --> 01:16:22.460
But don't worry,
we've been draining you
every night, Max.

01:16:22.502 --> 01:16:24.379
We've been feeding
on your honey,

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:26.631
sucking on Dea's teat.

01:16:30.552 --> 01:16:33.096
It keeps us forever young.

01:16:33.179 --> 01:16:35.307
Your mother and I
are both 109, Max.

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.517
Going on 110.

01:16:37.601 --> 01:16:40.061
A hundred and fourteen
and a half.

01:16:40.145 --> 01:16:41.313
Ninety-three, bitch.

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:45.150
Your pal Lou is 128.

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:47.652
You're all fucking sick fucks!

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:50.155
Maybe you're right,

01:16:50.196 --> 01:16:53.283
but that's what keeps us
young and passionate.

01:16:53.366 --> 01:16:55.577
That's what makes us
fuck so much.

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:58.788
Oh, we fuck all the time.

01:16:58.872 --> 01:17:00.498
- You fucks!
- All the time.

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.876
- Constantly.
- Cocksuckers!

01:17:02.959 --> 01:17:05.295
You've taken everything
from us! Everything!

01:17:05.378 --> 01:17:06.338
To Dea!

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:07.714
- To Dea!
- Dea!

01:17:07.797 --> 01:17:08.840
- Dea!
- To Dea!

01:17:08.923 --> 01:17:09.883
To Dea!

01:17:09.966 --> 01:17:11.301
- Dea!
- To Dea!

01:17:11.384 --> 01:17:12.385
Dea!

01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:14.596
Why would you do this to me?

01:17:14.679 --> 01:17:17.807
We've given you so many chances
to be productive, son.

01:17:17.891 --> 01:17:21.686
Oh, we sent most
of our foster kids here

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.438
to collect Dea's nectar

01:17:23.521 --> 01:17:26.149
because you wasted
all of the opportunities

01:17:26.232 --> 01:17:27.609
we provided for you.

01:17:27.692 --> 01:17:28.860
I trusted you.

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:32.572
Max, you're my favorite.

01:17:32.656 --> 01:17:36.201
So we're going to take
quite a lot tonight, Max.

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:37.952
You better take it all,

01:17:38.036 --> 01:17:40.455
'cause if you don't,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:17:40.538 --> 01:17:43.041
That won't be possible
'cause when you awaken,

01:17:43.124 --> 01:17:46.211
you'll feel like
a 100-year-old man.

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:48.171
But you'll be with family.

01:17:48.254 --> 01:17:49.631
It's time.

01:17:50.507 --> 01:17:51.966
Open your mouth.

01:17:54.761 --> 01:17:57.806
Shut the fuck up.

01:17:57.889 --> 01:17:59.933
You know too much, Max.

01:18:00.558 --> 01:18:02.394
Time to join
your brother upstairs.

01:18:05.522 --> 01:18:07.691
Mmm. Don't move.

01:18:13.697 --> 01:18:16.282
- To dearest Dea.
- To Dea.

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:17.617
With love and gratitude.

01:18:17.701 --> 01:18:19.619
With love and gratitude.

01:18:19.703 --> 01:18:21.454
- Love and gratitude.
- Love and gratitude.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.124
Don't move, Max.

01:18:24.207 --> 01:18:25.834
Don't move.

01:18:27.544 --> 01:18:28.878
Hold him down.

01:18:28.962 --> 01:18:30.922
- Dea!
- Dea!

01:18:31.005 --> 01:18:32.173
To Dea!

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:35.635
- Dea!
- Fuck me!

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:38.680
Fuck me!

01:18:41.474 --> 01:18:42.726
Fuck me!

01:19:09.794 --> 01:19:11.171
Hey, kiddo.

01:19:12.672 --> 01:19:14.007
How you feeling, huh?

01:19:14.966 --> 01:19:16.342
I got ya.

01:19:16.426 --> 01:19:18.636
You'll be well cared for.
Don't you fret.

01:19:20.096 --> 01:19:21.139
I know.

01:19:22.015 --> 01:19:23.808
You're confused. I get that.

01:19:24.809 --> 01:19:26.770
Allow me to lift the fog.

01:19:27.771 --> 01:19:30.440
Oh, my sweet Norma.

01:19:30.482 --> 01:19:32.901
She wanted to save you.

01:19:32.942 --> 01:19:35.779
Sentimental reasons.
So she had to go.

01:19:37.989 --> 01:19:40.074
And that's when it came to me.

01:19:40.158 --> 01:19:41.785
Just a thought, you know?

01:19:44.162 --> 01:19:45.997
An epiphany, one might say.

01:19:46.706 --> 01:19:49.542
That, uh, we'd use
Norma's demise

01:19:49.626 --> 01:19:50.919
in our game with you.

01:19:53.004 --> 01:19:56.549
And we had the greatest time
of our long lives.

01:19:56.633 --> 01:19:57.967
Brainstorming,

01:19:58.718 --> 01:20:01.971
dressing up and down.

01:20:02.055 --> 01:20:03.515
Improvising.

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:05.809
The hoot...

01:20:05.892 --> 01:20:07.560
Right. What the fuck
does that mean?

01:20:07.644 --> 01:20:09.521
...to end
all hootenannies.

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.981
...the government is funding
this entire facility.

01:20:12.065 --> 01:20:14.609
Now, you remember
what I told you, Max?

01:20:15.693 --> 01:20:17.779
The enemy of old age
is not death.

01:20:17.862 --> 01:20:19.072
It is boredom.

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:23.993
We must fill the hours
with smiles.

01:20:24.077 --> 01:20:27.413
And we have so many,
many, many, many hours to fill.

01:20:28.998 --> 01:20:29.958
You rest now.

01:20:30.667 --> 01:20:32.585
We still need you.

01:20:33.837 --> 01:20:34.838
Your nectar.

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:35.977
Fuck you!

01:24:35.828 --> 01:24:38.915
Run! Now!

01:24:39.582 --> 01:24:41.250
Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:24:41.334 --> 01:24:42.502
No!

01:24:42.585 --> 01:24:44.629
No!

01:24:44.712 --> 01:24:46.714
- No!
- No, no! No!

01:24:46.798 --> 01:24:48.049
No, no, no, no!

01:25:10.571 --> 01:25:12.073
Max is coming!

01:25:12.156 --> 01:25:14.367
Max is killing us all!

01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:16.077
Run! Run!

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.121
Oh! Oh, my God!

01:25:19.372 --> 01:25:20.123
Oh!

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:24.168
Dea, protect me.
Dea, protect me.

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:25.878
Sadie, move. Move, move now.

01:25:33.553 --> 01:25:35.012
Motherfucker!

01:25:48.901 --> 01:25:51.028
Come on, motherfucker!

01:26:02.039 --> 01:26:05.334
Dea, protect me.
Dea, protect me.
Dea, protect me.

01:26:05.418 --> 01:26:07.712
Dea, protect me.
Dea, protect me.

01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:09.714
Dea, Dea, protect me...

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:13.176
No! No!

01:26:13.718 --> 01:26:14.886
No!

01:26:14.969 --> 01:26:16.679
I'm your friend.

01:26:16.762 --> 01:26:19.307
Max, stop! I said stop!

01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:20.474
Max!

01:26:22.602 --> 01:26:23.728
Max, don't!

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:26.564
Max, stop.
I will shoot you.

01:26:34.238 --> 01:26:35.531
Ahh!

01:26:55.259 --> 01:26:57.220
No, no, no! Ahh!

01:26:58.262 --> 01:27:00.556
No, no! Max! No!

01:27:04.477 --> 01:27:07.647
Come on,
let's get to the car!
Come on! Come on!

01:27:10.650 --> 01:27:11.859
Come on!

01:28:00.866 --> 01:28:02.285
I'm taking it all back, Lou.

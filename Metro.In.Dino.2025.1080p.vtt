00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:48.541
{\an8}-Straight?
-What? Oh, shit! Left!

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:50.375
{\an8}-Which left?
-The one we just passed.

00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:52.666
-Can you stop scrolling for five minutes?
-Why are you speeding like crazy?

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.666
Are you trying to catch a train
or something?

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.833
-So this is my fault?
-Yeah, totally!

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:56.583
I gave you one job,
and you still messed it up.

00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:58.291
If you want to keep scrolling
on Instagram, go sit in the back.

00:02:58.458 --> 00:02:59.500
Pihu, come sit here.

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:02.125
You've taken this route so many times.
How do you not remember?

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:03.541
Am I your personal GPS?

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.375
Shruti and I cherished
the madness we shared.

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:48.083
We held the sky in our hands
and reveled in adventure.

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:51.250
Nice one! Just jump.

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:53.541
Good to go.

00:03:57.666 --> 00:03:58.916
I love you!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.875
All we wanted was
a carefree flight through life.

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:05.125
But our families weren't cool
with our freedom.

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:10.750
Your dream to be a musician… gone!

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:13.000
Your freedom… gone!

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.125
All your dreams… gone!

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:17.125
We got married.

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:19.416
Responsibilities pushed us
from Delhi to Bangalore.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.416
Then came the corporate job,
the tie, and a used car on EMI.

00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:26.250
I didn't even notice when the keyboard
replaced my guitar.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:32.875
Why does life after marriage
Change so drastically?

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:34.583
Even though we've changed…

00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:38.041
-Our love remains pure
-Our love

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:42.875
-The rush, the madness, all the fun
-You and your crazy, still as one

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.333
Your obsession with
doing it out in the open

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:47.250
is going to get us in trouble one day.

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:49.458
But if we don't wrap ourselves
in the blanket of the stars above,

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:51.791
how will we feel the heat, my love?

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:56.625
But soon the world cast shadows
On our joy

00:04:56.875 --> 00:05:00.708
In two short years
Our bed turned into a stadium

00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:02.583
-When do we hear the good news?
-Exactly!

00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:03.625
You've done enough net practice.

00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:04.916
-Time to play the actual game.
-Exactly!

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.458
You've got your whole life ahead
of you to "build your careers."

00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:07.416
Exactly!

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.500
-Your biological clock's ticking!
-Exactly!

00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:11.791
-You want pure shilajit? You'll get it.
-Exactly!

00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:13.041
A cot beats a bed any day,

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:16.958
-just stick a pillow under the waist!
-Exactly!

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:21.000
It says two full pink lines.

00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:22.916
-Right?
-These are two full pink lines!

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.500
They're not dark enough to be sure.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.500
Please try once again.

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:28.625
Why don't you try?
My bladder's empty.

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:32.416
-He's lying.
-He's totally lying!

00:06:32.916 --> 00:06:33.875
This is from last night.

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:35.458
-Where'd you meet her?
-Online.

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:37.333
Does your wife know?

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.875
He thinks I don't know.

00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.166
Extra-tight T-shirts,
expensive deodorants,

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.625
spending hours in the bathroom.

00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:44.458
-Shibhu, it's not funny.
-Yeah, I know.

00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:47.333
-Did you guys kiss?
-Just a peck.

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:50.708
-No tongue.
-She's got an MBA.

00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:52.166
And I'm a mechanical engineer.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.875
MA in Psychology.
I mean, what are we doing, girls?

00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:56.875
No tongue, no cheating.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:57.958
No cheating?

00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:58.916
Seriously.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.833
Ma, I'm heading out with Anaya!

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.666
Okay, but no going past the gate.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.041
You've got such a perfect life, Kajol.

00:07:06.666 --> 00:07:07.625
Perfect? Nonsense!

00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:11.333
Perfect holidays, perfect food,
perfect relationships!

00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:13.458
I swear! It all looks perfect.

00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:19.541
They've got the wrong idea

00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:22.041
because of what I post on social media.

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:26.500
When life grows dim and loses spark

00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:35.750
My posts turn more colorful
To light the dark

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.166
But real life…

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.041
Real life hides somewhere

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.000
behind those posts.

00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:46.125
Kajol, please try to understand,
I'm not arguing with you.

00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:47.500
I'm explaining!

00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:50.291
And I'm not listening to you.
I'm ignoring you!

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:52.041
At least look at me
when I am talking to you!

00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:53.625
Humans have evolved,
for your information!

00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:55.208
We listen with our ears now, not our eyes!

00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:57.416
How many times do I have to tell you?
Don't leave your wet towel on the bed!

00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:05.166
Ever since I started having an affair,
my married life has actually improved.

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:08.750
I mean, all that nagging
and irritation of married life?

00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:09.791
It's all gone now.

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:13.333
I met Kajol 19 years ago.

00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:16.666
Before her, I'd met plenty of girls…

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.458
but none of their hands
ever fit into mine.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.750
Our fingers would always get tangled up.

00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:26.750
{\an8}But when I first held Kajol's
beautiful hands,

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:29.416
everything just clicked.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.458
Like a long-lost puzzle
falling into place.

00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:34.000
What happened next?

00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:37.750
One day, I finally worked up the courage
and took her out on a date to Mamta Momos,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.208
and popped the question.

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:41.416
{\an8}Yes!

00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:48.041
Kajol, look.
They're tearing down Mamta Momos!

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:50.541
{\an8}-What? I can't hear you!
-They're tearing down…

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:51.541
{\an8}What?

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:53.500
What about Mamta Momos?

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:56.875
They're tearing down Mamta Momos,
the monument of our love!

00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.291
Can you see this?

00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.375
Oh, shit!

00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:01.958
Damn it!
Does this look like the time to talk?!

00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:04.500
Just record it!

00:09:04.583 --> 00:09:08.333
When you get used to each other

00:09:08.416 --> 00:09:11.833
Every special thing becomes ordinary

00:09:11.916 --> 00:09:14.750
Electric bill and kids' vaccine

00:09:15.416 --> 00:09:19.166
Flat's EMI, a broken washing machine

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.916
We've found so many ways
To stay busy every day

00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:31.166
That we meet each other
Like strangers every day

00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:34.000
Even while lying
next to each other in bed,

00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:35.875
our eyes stay fixed on our screens.

00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:39.541
We're scared that if we
actually look at each other,

00:09:39.916 --> 00:09:43.291
maybe there won't be anything left to say.

00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:15.125
{\an8}We had a lot of fun.

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:36.750
{\an8}I'm forgetful.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.458
One time, we left the shopping mall…

00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:41.750
A family photo at the Taj Mahal

00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:44.333
hangs on the living room wall.

00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:48.875
Even if it were lost, no one would notice.

00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:53.333
Just a square mark would be left behind

00:10:53.916 --> 00:10:56.958
No one would miss it, trust me

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.291
That's my status in the house, too
You see

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:05.500
I'm like that photo

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:10.333
Before marriage,
I had a few dreams of my own.

00:11:11.416 --> 00:11:14.791
But I set all my dreams aside

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.500
To dedicate myself to everyone else's

00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:23.541
Everyone's dreams
Took their flight eventually

00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:28.833
And now, they don't have
Any time for little old me

00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:33.583
My only regret is that
I kept my dreams at bay for so long…

00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:36.666
that even they grew cold and turned away.

00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:41.083
Now, there's only one question in my heart

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:45.458
Who am I living for?

00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:49.916
How do I spend the rest of my life?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.208
For I've always been the caretaker

00:11:55.708 --> 00:12:00.750
But I never learned to take care of myself

00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:06.083
{\an8}We don't get a holiday
for Holi here in Bangalore.

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.916
It's just us covered in colors.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.416
You should've come.

00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:14.166
It was so much fun!

00:12:14.416 --> 00:12:15.541
So much fun!

00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:17.375
By the way,
my flight's delayed by an hour.

00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:18.625
-Is he the same guy?
-Okay.

00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:19.833
Anand, right?

00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.208
-No, it's…
-Oh!

00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:22.500
The one from Delhi?

00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:24.333
-See you at home.
-Okay. Bye.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.583
Home? Finally, some action?

00:12:26.666 --> 00:12:28.708
Hey! We're serious, okay?

00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:30.791
-Very serious.
-Serious!

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.125
He's the one!

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:33.666
-Not possible.
-Are you sure?

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.166
He's the one, I'm sure.

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:38.291
-One hundred percent! Sure!
-Hundred percent!

00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:39.583
Oh, my God!

00:12:39.666 --> 00:12:42.208
Hundred percent… sure.

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:44.166
Okay, Chumki.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.375
Actually, I'm not sure.

00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:49.083
I'm never sure.

00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:52.625
I'm permanently confused.
My status is unsure.

00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:55.250
This is my first problem…

00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:57.166
and it's got no cure.

00:12:57.833 --> 00:13:00.791
I was the class topper
and my family's biggest hope.

00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:03.875
Everyone expected me to become a doctor.

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:07.833
But then I realized it wasn't
the human body that intrigued me,

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.500
but the mysteries of the mind.

00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:11.875
So, I switched to psychology.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.416
But that too was not my cup of tea.

00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:17.375
Finally, I dropped everything
and did my MBA.

00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:20.708
Standing in line, CV in hand.
It's a rat race.

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.291
It's a crazy maze.

00:13:22.375 --> 00:13:25.166
In fact,
the only thing I'm sure of is that

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.583
I'm confused.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.500
Always confused.

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:31.458
My second problem?
I just can't confront anyone.

00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:33.000
Bullying in school, ragging in college.

00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:34.458
Now my boss harasses me every day.

00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:36.666
It's… disgusting!

00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958
I feel like giving him a whack!
But what can I do?

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.875
I'm a coward like that.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.541
Third problem?
I'm a little awkward socially.

00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:50.125
I have a thousand emotions
And no clue how to express them

00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:56.041
There's always a raging battle between
Thoughts in my head and the words I say

00:13:56.541 --> 00:14:00.041
Thank God for emojis!

00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:04.750
So I can have a conversation without
having to say anything.

00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:07.208
I need two drinks to start talking,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.458
but after four drinks,
I can't stop throwing up.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.458
So my situation is such that…

00:14:48.541 --> 00:14:49.541
What a guy!

00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:51.375
We thought he came down
to Bangalore for us.

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:53.541
Did you know he has a girl here
in Bangalore?

00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:55.125
-Not interested.
-What's her name?

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.250
Why even bother to find out?

00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:57.833
He switches girlfriends
every three months.

00:14:57.916 --> 00:14:58.791
Nonsense.

00:14:58.875 --> 00:15:00.083
We're already into the fourth month.

00:15:00.875 --> 00:15:02.583
-She's very special, okay?
-Yeah.

00:15:02.791 --> 00:15:04.208
So what's this "special" girl's name?
What's her name?

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.416
-Of course, I know.
-Have some shame.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.625
I know her name. Are you mad?

00:15:07.708 --> 00:15:09.583
-Have some shame.
-Wait… Are you crazy?

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:10.666
One second…

00:15:11.208 --> 00:15:13.291
-It's something sweet…
-Fruity!

00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:14.500
Sweetie!

00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:15.458
-Oh!
-See!

00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:16.416
-Sweetie!
-Sweetie!

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.958
Sweetie's the love
of my life right now, guys.

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:20.000
Hotel?

00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:21.916
No, I've got arrangements in every city.

00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:23.958
Hey, listen, stop on the left.

00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:25.125
Stop on the left, yeah.

00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:28.791
Look at that guy!

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:31.541
-Okay, see you guys!
-Okay!

00:15:32.041 --> 00:15:33.000
Bye!

00:15:33.416 --> 00:15:34.291
-Bye!
-Bye!

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:36.458
-Full-style, bro?
-Happy Holi, bro!

00:15:36.583 --> 00:15:38.041
-Happy Holi, bro! Check!
-Catch this.

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:40.666
Tell me the address, quick! We've
been going around in circles forever.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.666
Undress?

00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.666
No, address! Not "undress", address!

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.916
-Just tell us already.
-Note it down.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.750
-301…
-Speak up.

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:50.041
301…

00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:51.375
Bhakti Niwas.

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:52.833
Bhakti Aaa--.

00:15:53.041 --> 00:15:54.416
301, Bhakti Niwas.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.541
Sixth Cross.

00:15:55.708 --> 00:15:59.125
-Miller's Road.
-Miller's Road.

00:15:59.916 --> 00:16:00.875
-But…
-Bye!

00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:03.416
The keys?

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.000
-I'm fine.
-Look in her bag.

00:16:05.083 --> 00:16:06.500
Under the mat?

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.375
-Where are the keys?
-I found the keys!

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.416
Listen.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.583
-She's so cute.
-We can't drive.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.291
We can't drive, so call a cab.

00:16:20.666 --> 00:16:21.625
Yeah, baby?

00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:23.083
How long?

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:26.708
Yeah, the house is empty.
No one's here.

00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:28.791
Don't wear anything with buttons.

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:30.875
Okay, baby, bye.

00:16:31.208 --> 00:16:33.041
Hurry up, okay?
I'm in the mood.

00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:34.916
Bye.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.166
Hello?

00:16:42.625 --> 00:16:44.000
Hello, who's this?

00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:46.125
You called, so you tell me.

00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:47.166
Where's Chumki?

00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:48.458
Give her the phone.

00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:51.583
Bro, I'm not her servant.

00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:52.666
Who the hell are you?

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.708
Listen, I want to speak to my girlfriend.

00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:57.083
She's not interested, bro.

00:16:57.208 --> 00:16:59.583
Let her be. Let her live her life.

00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:00.583
This is not funny.

00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:02.500
Why do you even have her phone?
Chumki!

00:17:02.583 --> 00:17:04.791
"No one can claim another's soul.

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:07.750
True love needs trust to make it whole."

00:17:08.083 --> 00:17:09.000
Bye.

00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:39.666
Hello!

00:17:40.708 --> 00:17:41.666
Hello!

00:17:42.125 --> 00:17:43.166
Hello, wake up!

00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:45.833
Wake up already!

00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:50.958
Baby…

00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:55.916
Meow.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.208
Hello!

00:18:07.791 --> 00:18:08.791
Who are you?

00:18:22.666 --> 00:18:24.333
Thief!

00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:25.625
Please!

00:18:25.916 --> 00:18:28.500
Thief…

00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:34.291
Help!

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.333
Thief! Thief!

00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:38.083
Help…

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.708
-Thief!
-Stop!

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:47.416
Is this your home?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Is this your place?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.125
Seriously, look around.

00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.000
-Is this your place?
-Is it--

00:19:08.208 --> 00:19:09.583
Where's my house?

00:19:14.291 --> 00:19:16.000
Where's my house?

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.208
Your body language kind of gave away
what you were talking about.

00:19:21.333 --> 00:19:23.916
He hinted that he's involved
in infertility.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.500
Infertility?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.125
You mean infidelity.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.625
Yeah, infidelity.

00:19:28.708 --> 00:19:31.083
It's nothing really.
He's just fooling around.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.041
-Fooling…
-Probably dealing with boredom, I guess.

00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:35.958
And you're justifying it?

00:19:36.083 --> 00:19:37.458
I'm not justifying it.

00:19:37.666 --> 00:19:39.458
Everyone has their own
sense of morality.

00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:42.208
I feel really bad for Priya, you know.

00:19:42.291 --> 00:19:43.791
Good night, Ma.
Good night, Papa.

00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:45.000
-Good night.
-Good night.

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:46.625
-Love you.
-Love you too.

00:19:49.625 --> 00:19:52.958
So, do you keep things from me?

00:19:54.125 --> 00:19:57.000
I know you also want to fool around.

00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:02.833
Look, if you do it, I'll do it too.

00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:04.250
What?

00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:05.875
But I haven't done anything, right?

00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:08.125
You're totally off track here.
"If you do it, I'll do it too."

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.250
I'm just saying.

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:10.958
I'm so sorry.

00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:13.750
-Yeah, yeah, no problem.
-I thought this was my…

00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:16.000
-My bag.
-Oh, yes.

00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:16.958
Oh shit!

00:20:17.291 --> 00:20:18.708
Not now.

00:20:19.166 --> 00:20:21.083
Hurry up and leave,
my girlfriend will be here any second.

00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:22.041
Parth?

00:20:22.125 --> 00:20:24.125
Great, one girlfriend leaves,
and the other walks right in.

00:20:24.208 --> 00:20:26.125
-No, baby.
-Who's next after me?

00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:27.083
You cheat!

00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:28.458
-Excuse me, there's been a--
-Shut up!

00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:30.958
-Baby, she just got here by accident.
-Oh wow!

00:20:31.041 --> 00:20:32.666
Her clothes were taken off by mistake.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.375
You have shown your true nature.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.333
-What?
-Unbelievable.

00:20:36.416 --> 00:20:37.541
Don't call me again.

00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:48.250
What's your address?

00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:50.583
301, Bhakti Awaas.

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:51.541
What?

00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:53.000
301, Bhakti--

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:55.833
Bhakti Niwas.

00:20:55.916 --> 00:20:56.791
Let's go.

00:21:16.291 --> 00:21:17.875
Bhakti Awaas.

00:21:18.541 --> 00:21:19.583
Be careful there.

00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:20.916
Watch your step.

00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:22.875
Helmet, my helmet.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.875
What?!

00:21:42.291 --> 00:21:43.708
I can't believe this.

00:21:44.125 --> 00:21:45.666
Sis, this isn't funny, okay?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
It's not funny.

00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:47.958
Kajol, you shut up.

00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:49.500
-This is serious.
-Oh God!

00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:51.125
His mom's already called like three times

00:21:51.208 --> 00:21:53.625
and said they'll delay
the engagement.

00:21:54.708 --> 00:21:56.208
Should I call her, Ma?

00:21:56.291 --> 00:21:57.250
Absolutely not.

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:58.750
No need for any explanations.

00:21:58.833 --> 00:22:00.250
He should trust you.

00:22:00.583 --> 00:22:02.833
Who would trust this story?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.833
Who'd believe the confusion between
Bhakti Awaas and Bhakti Niwas?

00:22:05.916 --> 00:22:08.041
Chumki, you're the only one
who could pull this off.

00:22:08.125 --> 00:22:09.750
-This isn't funny!
-I have an idea.

00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:11.833
Take Anand to Bhakti Awaas.

00:22:12.083 --> 00:22:14.041
-It's Bhakti Niwas, Ma.
-Whatever.

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:16.291
Take him there,
he'll see it with his own eyes

00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:17.583
and believe you.

00:22:17.666 --> 00:22:19.000
Chumki, you're not doing that.

00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:20.750
Anand should trust you.

00:22:20.833 --> 00:22:22.500
You two are going
to spend your lives together!

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.541
Don't mislead her, Kajol.

00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:26.625
Ma, I agree, we need to do something.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.958
Take him there.
He'll see it himself.

00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:30.458
It wouldn't be an issue

00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:33.166
-if he were that easy to convince.
-What a jerk he is, you know!

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:34.166
Just stop it.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.958
Fine, hold on.
Should I talk to him?

00:22:36.875 --> 00:22:38.333
Guys, please, stop it.

00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:39.875
Don't give him that much importance.

00:22:40.041 --> 00:22:42.666
I'll talk to him, explain it nicely,
and he'll understand.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.791
Chumki, don't listen to her.
Listen, I'm telling you.

00:22:44.875 --> 00:22:46.833
No, I think I should talk to him.

00:22:46.916 --> 00:22:47.791
I'll sort it out.

00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:48.833
No, Chumki, just listen to me.

00:22:48.916 --> 00:22:50.250
One sec, you listen to me first.

00:22:50.416 --> 00:22:51.666
-Kajol, stay out of this.
-I'll handle it.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.625
You don't need to do it.
That's what I'm trying to say!

00:22:53.708 --> 00:22:55.041
Can I say something, guys?

00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:56.833
Let her decide.

00:22:56.916 --> 00:22:58.708
-She'll decide, Ma. I'm just telling her.
-Let me decide.

00:22:58.791 --> 00:23:00.916
-You just have to…
-I can't handle two mothers at once.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.083
-She interferes with everything.
-Fine, bye-bye.

00:23:02.166 --> 00:23:03.041
I'll handle it.

00:23:03.125 --> 00:23:04.000
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:23:30.458 --> 00:23:31.708
-Hey, you!
-Watch out.

00:23:34.416 --> 00:23:35.916
-What?
-You're trying to run me over?

00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:38.458
You go back inside.

00:23:38.666 --> 00:23:39.666
Baba!

00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:40.916
Can't you see the signal?

00:23:41.125 --> 00:23:42.666
Just keep quiet and come inside!

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.250
-Look at me, you were trying to--
-Baba, come inside.

00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:45.208
-No, I wasn't!
-Come on.

00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.916
-Baba!
-I'm coming!

00:23:47.041 --> 00:23:48.541
{\an8}Are you coming,
or should I come down?

00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:49.791
-Go on.
-Baba.

00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:51.083
-Coming!
-Baba!

00:23:52.416 --> 00:23:53.916
-Alright, go.
-Just come inside!

00:23:54.541 --> 00:23:57.166
Why do you do that?
Scold me in front of everyone?

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.791
Why do you keep
doing stuff like that?

00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:00.291
If you don't do it,
I won't have to scold you.

00:24:00.958 --> 00:24:02.083
Here are your meds.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.125
Don't forget to take them.

00:24:05.166 --> 00:24:06.125
Anything else?

00:24:06.541 --> 00:24:08.416
Just turn off the washing machine.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.958
You don't need to dry the clothes.

00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:12.500
And you've got some invites.

00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:14.875
Go through them when you can.
I'll be late today.

00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:16.500
Oh, you forgot your charger.

00:24:17.208 --> 00:24:19.583
I forget everything because of you.

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:20.791
So this is my fault too?

00:24:21.708 --> 00:24:22.666
Yes, of course.

00:24:22.833 --> 00:24:23.791
Who else do I have?

00:24:37.791 --> 00:24:39.458
Announces the departure of its flight…

00:24:39.541 --> 00:24:42.541
Hello? Who's this?

00:24:42.708 --> 00:24:44.750
All passengers are requested
to please proceed towards the gate…

00:24:44.833 --> 00:24:45.791
Who?

00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:49.291
Okay. So, who are you?

00:24:50.208 --> 00:24:51.500
Your wife's friend.

00:24:52.083 --> 00:24:53.083
And I am?

00:24:54.166 --> 00:24:55.500
My friend's husband.

00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:57.250
The one who dropped me off at home.

00:24:57.541 --> 00:24:58.541
On his bike?

00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:01.333
The one who spoke
to him over the phone?

00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:03.333
-Who?
-Anand!

00:25:04.083 --> 00:25:05.416
-Okay, so I'm both.
-Yes.

00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:07.000
Okay.

00:25:07.208 --> 00:25:08.541
Good. Nice.

00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:10.625
Okay, so what's the plan?

00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:13.375
Tonight, my colleagues are having a party.

00:25:13.458 --> 00:25:14.333
Alright.

00:25:14.416 --> 00:25:17.166
So you and your wife, aka my friend,

00:25:17.791 --> 00:25:19.125
will run into me and Anand.

00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:20.083
Okay?

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:21.750
It'll clear up his doubts.

00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:23.083
He'll obviously see that we didn't…

00:25:23.166 --> 00:25:24.208
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

00:25:25.708 --> 00:25:27.666
If he's that suspicious,
why don't you just leave him?

00:25:27.958 --> 00:25:29.458
I didn't ask for relationship advice.

00:25:29.833 --> 00:25:31.041
If you can't help me, then…

00:25:31.125 --> 00:25:32.291
But who's going to be my wife?

00:25:33.333 --> 00:25:34.291
You have someone in mind?

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:36.458
Single, under 25, and beautiful?

00:25:37.041 --> 00:25:38.000
Know anyone?

00:25:39.708 --> 00:25:40.833
Fine, I'll take care of it.

00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:45.375
In the meantime,
book me a flight and hotel.

00:25:45.583 --> 00:25:47.125
-Business Class, of course.
-Done.

00:25:47.666 --> 00:25:48.875
I only stay in five-star hotels.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:51.666
Hey, Shruti…

00:25:51.958 --> 00:25:53.416
So we are a couple.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.541
Chumki was with us.
We got sloshed.

00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.833
And my boss's name is Anand,
and you hate him.

00:25:57.916 --> 00:25:58.875
Yes, yes.

00:25:59.833 --> 00:26:02.166
I know all of Chumki's friends,

00:26:02.333 --> 00:26:04.458
but I haven't heard of you two before.

00:26:05.083 --> 00:26:06.125
Shruti.

00:26:06.541 --> 00:26:08.166
She's a colleague.
I told you about her.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.125
Yes.

00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:10.125
Shruti what?

00:26:10.291 --> 00:26:11.166
Shukla.

00:26:11.791 --> 00:26:12.666
And you?

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.958
Parth Nakul Sahadev.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.500
Wait, you're a Shukla
and he's a Sahadev?

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.625
Confusing, right?

00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:22.083
Yesterday was even more confusing.

00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:23.416
-So we got…
-Don't drink, don't drink.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.458
-You really shouldn't be drinking anymore.
-I'm fine.

00:26:25.541 --> 00:26:27.375
-You're not fine.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:26:27.458 --> 00:26:28.791
The same thing happened
yesterday, too, right?

00:26:28.875 --> 00:26:30.166
It's so embarrassing.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.916
You didn't tell us what you do.

00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:35.416
Well, my target is
to win the Green Nobel 2025.

00:26:36.375 --> 00:26:38.666
I'm working on the automated
absorption and assimilation

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.625
of the cosmic vitality for
the self-irrigation and sustainability

00:26:42.708 --> 00:26:43.791
of the human condition.

00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:47.750
Basically, I invented
human photosynthesis.

00:26:49.208 --> 00:26:50.125
What?

00:26:50.625 --> 00:26:51.583
Trees…

00:26:53.208 --> 00:26:54.958
Ever seen trees working?

00:26:57.458 --> 00:26:58.708
Getting scolded by their boss?

00:26:59.291 --> 00:27:00.416
-No.
-Why?

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.416
Because trees make their own food.

00:27:04.458 --> 00:27:06.125
So, what's the basic need for humans?

00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.458
Food, right?

00:27:08.208 --> 00:27:09.666
So, we need to become like trees.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.833
-How?
-Very simple process.

00:27:12.916 --> 00:27:15.500
Wake up early, face the sun,

00:27:15.625 --> 00:27:17.041
and raise one hand.

00:27:17.208 --> 00:27:18.833
It acts like an antenna.

00:27:18.916 --> 00:27:21.958
Put the other hand down here.

00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:24.375
Look down, aim, and pee on your feet.

00:27:25.416 --> 00:27:28.416
You've got to nourish yourself
with your own water.

00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:31.041
That's it. Human photosynthesis.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.000
Produce your own food.

00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:34.083
That's the idea.

00:27:34.166 --> 00:27:35.625
He's joking.

00:27:35.875 --> 00:27:37.458
He's actually a travel blogger.

00:27:37.583 --> 00:27:38.875
He has 150,000 followers.

00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:40.500
He's got a weird sense of humor,

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.208
but he's a good soul.

00:27:42.583 --> 00:27:43.666
He's got a big heart.

00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:46.166
Yeah, I can't show you
what is bigger than my heart.

00:27:46.458 --> 00:27:47.333
Come on, Parth.

00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:51.291
It's a joke.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.416
Brain, guys.
You guys have dirty minds.

00:27:55.833 --> 00:27:58.250
This is actually a tradition
in our group.

00:27:58.375 --> 00:28:00.416
We all share our love stories musically.

00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:01.833
Just wait. You'll have fun!

00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:05.041
So, listen, here's what happened…

00:28:05.666 --> 00:28:06.958
We're a couple, you know.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.333
And Chumki was with us.

00:28:09.458 --> 00:28:11.791
My boss's name is also Anand.

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:13.750
Parth really hates him.

00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:15.166
So, in his drunken stupor,

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.333
he picked up your call
and screwed you over.

00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:28.291
Both Tinder and Aisle
Matched our profile

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.750
His bio was unique
And radius within a mile

00:28:31.833 --> 00:28:35.958
After 52 right swipes
This miracle transpired

00:28:36.041 --> 00:28:38.291
I was totally worth it, okay?

00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:43.208
Muskaan Dua entered my life
To change it forever

00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:48.583
The first time I saw her smile so wide

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.083
And her braces twinkled just like mine

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.666
We tried to kiss, but got stuck in a mess

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.208
Our braces tangled, leaving us
In a state of crazy distress

00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:00.416
It was such a shocking sight

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.041
That even the dentist was taken by fright.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.750
That was then, and this is now.

00:29:03.833 --> 00:29:05.000
We've been together for three years.

00:29:05.083 --> 00:29:07.041
But he still hasn't deleted Tinder,

00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:08.791
because what if he finds someone better!

00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:11.208
Is this just Netflix and chill

00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:14.625
Or wedding vows
And the morning-after pill?

00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:19.666
Tell us, guys, how do we differentiate?

00:29:19.833 --> 00:29:22.875
Is this love, or just lust at play?

00:29:22.958 --> 00:29:25.083
Is it heart-driven indeed?

00:29:25.541 --> 00:29:28.541
Or just a mind's itch?

00:29:28.958 --> 00:29:33.500
Tell us, friends, how do we differentiate?

00:29:33.791 --> 00:29:36.875
Is this love, or just lust at play?

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.916
Nice!

00:29:39.666 --> 00:29:43.666
-Your turn, your turn, Chumki!
-Yes.

00:29:43.833 --> 00:29:44.958
-Sing.
-Yeah, come on, sing.

00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:47.625
Yeah, yeah, please,
I'd love to know this fairytale too,

00:29:47.708 --> 00:29:48.791
so I can die in peace.

00:29:49.041 --> 00:29:50.500
Sing it.

00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:54.833
Was it a coincidence or was it destiny?

00:29:54.916 --> 00:29:56.500
First same college

00:29:56.833 --> 00:29:58.250
Then the same company

00:29:58.333 --> 00:30:01.708
How do I describe us as a couple?

00:30:01.791 --> 00:30:05.166
We're like the same phone and charger

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.583
Tell them how I proposed.

00:30:06.666 --> 00:30:07.916
-Go on, tell them.
-Yeah, tell us.

00:30:08.791 --> 00:30:12.250
On my pizza, he drew a heart with ketchup

00:30:12.333 --> 00:30:15.666
Then with mayonnaise, I made an arrow
Pointing through

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.125
He wrote, "Sweetheart, I love you forever"

00:30:19.208 --> 00:30:22.708
From that day on, I've had no more pizza
Just this screensaver

00:30:25.458 --> 00:30:27.750
Right from our first day

00:30:28.083 --> 00:30:31.208
We became each other's soulmates

00:30:31.625 --> 00:30:36.291
Our hearts are sure
There's no space for doubt

00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:39.458
This is love, true love
And we claim it out loud!

00:30:39.583 --> 00:30:41.625
Is it heart-driven indeed?

00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:45.125
Or just a mind's itch?

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:50.041
Tell us, guys, how do we differentiate?

00:30:50.333 --> 00:30:53.541
Is this love, or just lust at play?

00:30:58.458 --> 00:31:00.500
I set out to meet one

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:03.750
But someone else crossed my path

00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:07.958
My plans took a turn

00:31:08.208 --> 00:31:10.791
And so did my heart

00:31:10.958 --> 00:31:12.583
-Wow!
-Mind blowing!

00:31:12.666 --> 00:31:17.500
Drunk, she shamelessly
Embraced me with flair

00:31:18.333 --> 00:31:24.875
Then softly she whispered
Something in my ear

00:31:24.958 --> 00:31:25.875
What?

00:31:28.125 --> 00:31:30.083
My heart skipped a beat
Then it raced like a train

00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:31.916
Somehow, in that moment
I fell for the game

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
So do we chase the fun

00:31:34.375 --> 00:31:37.416
Or seal our fate with a lifelong run?

00:31:37.916 --> 00:31:42.291
Guys, tell us
For how do we stay in this dilemma?

00:31:42.625 --> 00:31:45.666
Is this love, or just lust at play?

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:49.375
Is it soul-driven indeed?

00:31:49.458 --> 00:31:51.333
Or just a body's plea?

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:56.250
Tell us, guys, how do we differentiate?

00:31:56.583 --> 00:31:59.583
Is this love, or just lust at play?

00:31:59.666 --> 00:32:01.750
Do we pay heed to the heart indeed?

00:32:02.208 --> 00:32:05.250
Or listen to the mind's desires?

00:32:05.708 --> 00:32:10.291
Tell us, guys, how do we differentiate?

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.708
Is this love, or just lust at play?

00:32:16.416 --> 00:32:18.333
Lust! Lust, 100%!

00:32:20.541 --> 00:32:22.833
I don't know how people manage
to remove time on the weekdays.

00:32:22.958 --> 00:32:23.833
I don't get it.

00:32:23.916 --> 00:32:25.708
-Even I don't get it, bro.
-Exactly!

00:32:25.791 --> 00:32:27.125
I don't know!

00:32:27.291 --> 00:32:28.791
I have all the time in the world, bro.

00:32:28.916 --> 00:32:30.291
Hang on a second.

00:32:31.041 --> 00:32:32.208
You're trying to imitate me, right?

00:32:32.458 --> 00:32:35.041
-No, bro, just exercising.
-I know you are.

00:32:35.125 --> 00:32:36.041
My cab is here.

00:32:36.291 --> 00:32:38.208
-What can I do? It's an old habit.
-No…

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.833
Have you saved my number?

00:32:43.083 --> 00:32:44.125
Yes, of course.

00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:46.000
Show me.

00:32:47.041 --> 00:32:48.083
Show me?

00:32:50.458 --> 00:32:52.500
I'm deleting it.
I'm so sorry.

00:32:53.291 --> 00:32:54.166
Please don't mind.

00:32:55.291 --> 00:32:56.166
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.125
-Bye.
-Chumki!

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:58.083
Bye.

00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:00.333
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:33:00.416 --> 00:33:01.791
Yeah, bye-bye.

00:33:01.958 --> 00:33:02.833
Feeling screwed?

00:33:03.333 --> 00:33:04.833
She deleted her number!

00:33:04.958 --> 00:33:06.916
-That's embarrassing!
-It's crazy.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.958
But…

00:33:12.416 --> 00:33:13.416
Let's go.

00:33:14.375 --> 00:33:15.625
-No.
-Why?

00:33:19.875 --> 00:33:21.750
Parth! You're such a rascal.

00:33:22.833 --> 00:33:24.083
No! Parth!

00:33:31.958 --> 00:33:34.458
MISCHIEVOUS HUSBAND

00:33:40.083 --> 00:33:41.000
Hey, Siri.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.500
I'm 15 years old.

00:33:43.958 --> 00:33:47.375
How do I figure out
if I like girls or boys?

00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:52.625
At the age of 15, it is entirely normal
to be exploring your sexual identity.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.583
It is a personal journey,
and it may take time.

00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:57.000
There is no right or wrong…

00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:03.291
I've gotta be up at 5:30 a.m. tomorrow.

00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:05.125
Pihu's got basketball practice.

00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:07.208
Oh, okay.

00:34:07.333 --> 00:34:08.375
Let's do it on Saturday?

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.625
I'll be late that day.

00:34:12.375 --> 00:34:13.500
Oh, got it.

00:34:13.583 --> 00:34:14.708
Wanna try Sunday instead?

00:34:15.541 --> 00:34:16.625
Sunday.

00:34:16.708 --> 00:34:17.875
Sunday…

00:34:19.708 --> 00:34:21.750
Maybe we just do it next weekend?

00:34:27.958 --> 00:34:29.000
Okay.

00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:31.833
What are you looking at?

00:34:33.666 --> 00:34:34.666
My hand.

00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:38.041
It's starting to look like my dad's.

00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:40.958
Same wrinkles on the fingers…

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:45.333
Same crisscross lines on the palm.

00:34:47.083 --> 00:34:48.958
Feels like my life's turning into his.

00:34:50.958 --> 00:34:52.500
He was an amazing singer, you know.

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:57.583
But he lived such an ordinary life.

00:34:58.583 --> 00:35:00.291
Average job, average income.

00:35:01.416 --> 00:35:02.625
Why? Because he was raising me.

00:35:03.625 --> 00:35:04.791
He had to keep the house running.

00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:06.541
And then?

00:35:10.833 --> 00:35:11.958
Then what?

00:35:15.791 --> 00:35:16.750
Then…

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.250
Amazing father.

00:35:18.916 --> 00:35:20.083
Unrecognized singer.

00:35:20.875 --> 00:35:22.125
A very average life,

00:35:22.875 --> 00:35:26.125
and an unremarkable death.

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.416
Why are you going in circles?

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.375
Just say it.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.083
It's not that easy.

00:35:34.916 --> 00:35:36.041
What's not easy?

00:35:36.791 --> 00:35:38.500
If I say it, you'll feel bad.

00:35:42.208 --> 00:35:43.333
I won't.

00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:45.750
Just tell me.

00:35:51.833 --> 00:35:53.833
You quit your job.

00:35:54.916 --> 00:35:56.458
I feel stuck in a loop.

00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:59.833
And I'll have to keep
slogging like this forever.

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:01.708
You weren't comfortable…

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.291
with Bangalore-Delhi,
long distance.

00:36:05.875 --> 00:36:06.916
I didn't just quit a job,

00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:08.875
I sacrificed my career.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.416
Akash…

00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:23.041
you know you close your eyes
when you sing?

00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:26.791
It's like you drift off
to another world.

00:36:28.791 --> 00:36:30.041
That's where you belong.

00:36:31.125 --> 00:36:33.833
I don't know
where that freaking "la-la-land" is.

00:36:34.791 --> 00:36:35.708
I know…

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.250
and that world will disappear.

00:36:41.083 --> 00:36:44.125
If we try to build this new world here.

00:36:45.416 --> 00:36:47.333
Wonder whether we will ever get it.

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.041
At least try it once.

00:36:52.333 --> 00:36:54.166
Or else you will regret it all your life.

00:36:55.625 --> 00:36:56.625
I don't know.

00:36:57.333 --> 00:36:58.791
Of course, you do.

00:37:02.291 --> 00:37:03.916
We both do.

00:37:05.166 --> 00:37:06.083
Know what?

00:37:08.541 --> 00:37:09.416
That this…

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.208
this can wait.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.375
It takes a lifetime

00:37:28.791 --> 00:37:34.000
{\an8}-For a sigh to take effect
-Sign here.

00:37:37.541 --> 00:37:44.416
Who lives to see everything work out?

00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:48.416
Ma'am, just change into this
and give me your bag.

00:37:48.958 --> 00:37:51.583
A hundred beastly mouths

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.125
-Lie within each wave
-I'll be back in two minutes.

00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:03.166
Look what the speck endures till

00:38:04.458 --> 00:38:08.458
It becomes a pearl

00:38:11.333 --> 00:38:18.083
The sky and the ground stood still
Until the sunrise

00:38:18.833 --> 00:38:25.625
I have paused, and you should too
Wait till things are alright

00:38:26.458 --> 00:38:33.291
When I am with you
The distances will vanish

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:40.750
What to say with words?
Let's wait until the decision is made

00:38:40.875 --> 00:38:42.625
-Monty!
-Come for the photo.

00:38:43.625 --> 00:38:44.666
Coming.

00:38:46.708 --> 00:38:47.625
Is everybody here?

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.916
-Are you sure?
-Hundred percent, sir.

00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:05.083
Look at Rodriguez. He quit
the job four years ago.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.875
He wanted to write a novel.

00:39:07.208 --> 00:39:08.291
Ended up exhausting his funds.

00:39:09.375 --> 00:39:10.416
You should give it a shot, too.

00:39:11.166 --> 00:39:14.291
Why don't you take a month off
and try it out?

00:39:14.416 --> 00:39:15.791
Safety net kills the drive, sir.

00:39:18.125 --> 00:39:19.208
I'll take my chances.

00:39:21.916 --> 00:39:23.958
Yes, definitely.
I can start next week.

00:39:26.333 --> 00:39:28.666
Yes, sir. I'm ready to focus
on my career this time.

00:39:29.708 --> 00:39:30.916
And thank you for taking me back.

00:39:33.791 --> 00:39:38.750
Are we surrounded by answers
Or are the answers unreachable?

00:39:41.416 --> 00:39:46.125
Are we drowning in questions
Or are the questions suppressed?

00:39:46.583 --> 00:39:48.833
FIND ME A HOUSE FIRST

00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:54.416
Why does the light hide in both?
Tell me, will you?

00:39:56.791 --> 00:40:03.166
Surrounded and pressed
Light hides until it's through

00:40:04.166 --> 00:40:05.791
-The sky…
-Hi.

00:40:05.875 --> 00:40:07.708
-And the ground stood still…
-Hi.

00:40:07.958 --> 00:40:09.750
-Here.
-Look at this, how is it?

00:40:10.416 --> 00:40:11.500
Here. Speak.

00:40:11.625 --> 00:40:13.875
Show us the view.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.958
Nice.

00:40:15.708 --> 00:40:18.583
Until the sunrise…

00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:20.250
All the signs are there.

00:40:20.333 --> 00:40:22.291
Don't you think? It could be.

00:40:22.416 --> 00:40:23.541
Darling, what are you doing?

00:40:23.625 --> 00:40:25.791
Put it on the table.
We should be able to see the screen.

00:40:26.125 --> 00:40:27.541
Or are you trying to hide something?

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:33.750
What to say with words?
Let's wait until the decision is made

00:40:41.458 --> 00:40:43.666
-Shruti, hi!
-Hi, how are you?

00:40:44.166 --> 00:40:45.708
-Ritu?
-I'm fine!

00:40:45.875 --> 00:40:47.125
-All ready?
-Yes, sir…

00:40:47.208 --> 00:40:48.750
Sir, just…

00:40:48.833 --> 00:40:49.958
I need…

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:52.375
-Hi.
-Shruti, meet Amay.

00:40:52.458 --> 00:40:53.708
He's your new cameraman.

00:40:54.208 --> 00:40:55.125
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:40:55.208 --> 00:40:56.208
-Shruti, right?
-Shruti.

00:40:56.375 --> 00:40:57.250
Amay.

00:40:57.333 --> 00:40:58.291
Nice to meet you.

00:40:58.625 --> 00:40:59.958
I asked life,

00:41:00.416 --> 00:41:01.791
"What's your address?"

00:41:01.916 --> 00:41:05.750
Life said, "Take the first right,
then go get lost!"

00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:11.000
I stood still,
and the ground started to move.

00:41:15.291 --> 00:41:16.333
What happened?

00:41:19.166 --> 00:41:20.500
-Ready?
-Sir, this is Akash,

00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:22.000
-the guy I told you about.
-Akash!

00:41:22.708 --> 00:41:24.458
-Heard you quit your job.
-Yeah.

00:41:24.541 --> 00:41:25.750
Do or die?

00:41:26.333 --> 00:41:28.333
I've made some songs
I'd love for you to hear.

00:41:28.708 --> 00:41:30.666
Alright, send them to me.

00:41:30.833 --> 00:41:31.708
WhatsApp them.

00:41:31.791 --> 00:41:32.916
-Give him my number.
-Yes, sir.

00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:35.583
Sir, if I could play them live,
that would be great.

00:41:35.833 --> 00:41:38.458
I'll listen when I have time, no?
With a free mind.

00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:40.083
I'll hear them.
Just send them over.

00:41:40.916 --> 00:41:42.916
Stick with it. Don't quit.

00:41:49.208 --> 00:41:54.250
{\an8}My paths no longer know
Of your path lies for sure

00:41:56.833 --> 00:42:00.916
{\an8}My city is yours no more

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.291
{\an8}It's the tenth day, and the students
are still going strong with the protest.

00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:04.583
But the national examination officer…

00:42:04.666 --> 00:42:09.833
Life feels twisted, like lost in thought
Even with spring, joy is not brought

00:42:12.166 --> 00:42:18.583
We drift apart, step by step each day
Until all trust fades away

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.166
The sky and the ground stood still

00:42:23.333 --> 00:42:26.041
Until the sunrise

00:42:27.041 --> 00:42:33.875
Like I have paused, you too
Should wait till things are alright

00:42:34.708 --> 00:42:41.416
I'll live and die with you as distance
Grows and strays

00:42:42.458 --> 00:42:49.250
What to say with words?
Let's wait until the decision is made

00:42:55.666 --> 00:42:56.958
Till things are alright

00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:04.666
Till things are alright

00:43:15.458 --> 00:43:16.458
Hi.

00:43:16.625 --> 00:43:17.541
Hey.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:19.625
Single or married?

00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:21.541
You first.

00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:24.791
Married and bored.

00:43:32.666 --> 00:43:35.500
It's the story of every home
and household.

00:43:35.583 --> 00:43:36.583
Same here.

00:43:39.125 --> 00:43:40.666
Why? Your wife is boring?

00:43:42.291 --> 00:43:43.916
Yes, yes. A little.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.375
What about your husband?

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:49.333
He's right now in the same room.

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.208
Oh, poor thing.

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:58.291
Don't sympathize,
he's a cheating rascal.

00:43:59.333 --> 00:44:01.333
Oh, sorry.

00:44:05.208 --> 00:44:07.916
WBU? This is your first affair?

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.416
Hey, what does "WBU"
mean in a text message?

00:44:17.958 --> 00:44:18.875
What about you?!

00:44:18.958 --> 00:44:20.541
Okay.

00:44:21.333 --> 00:44:23.833
Are we having an affair?

00:44:24.166 --> 00:44:26.708
No,
I'm just here looking for siblings.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.791
{\an8}You are quite funny.

00:44:34.416 --> 00:44:36.291
Not boring, right? Like your wife?

00:44:39.916 --> 00:44:42.250
You aren't like her at all.

00:44:50.458 --> 00:44:53.291
What do you look like right now?

00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:33.541
OUR ROMEO AND JULIET
LOVE YOU BOTH

00:45:38.166 --> 00:45:39.583
-Done?
-Yeah.

00:45:45.625 --> 00:45:46.750
Rohan!

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.375
Hello, Uncle.

00:45:48.458 --> 00:45:49.416
When did you get back?

00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:51.166
Day before yesterday.

00:45:51.958 --> 00:45:54.208
And you're showing up now,
after two whole days?

00:45:54.458 --> 00:45:55.458
Well…

00:45:57.458 --> 00:45:59.458
Bantu, come back tomorrow. Go on.

00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:01.000
Okay, see you tomorrow.

00:46:05.583 --> 00:46:06.625
If Aabir were with us,

00:46:07.333 --> 00:46:08.833
you'd have come straight
from the airport.

00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:10.541
Well…

00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:12.375
I couldn't avoid this trip.

00:46:12.666 --> 00:46:15.250
There are a few things I need
to wrap up.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.500
You're staying for a few days?

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.291
Yeah, about eight to ten days.

00:46:20.875 --> 00:46:21.750
Once I leave this time,

00:46:21.833 --> 00:46:23.166
I probably won't be back for
a couple of years.

00:46:26.541 --> 00:46:27.625
Baba, I'm heading out.

00:46:27.916 --> 00:46:29.208
Weren't you going somewhere too?

00:46:29.291 --> 00:46:30.625
Rohan will drop you.

00:46:30.791 --> 00:46:32.416
No, Baba, I've already booked a cab.

00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:38.833
-Uncle, I should get going too.
-Alright, go ahead.

00:46:38.916 --> 00:46:40.250
-I'll come see you before I leave.
-Okay.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.458
Take care.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.833
Jhinuk! Jhinuk!
What do you want?

00:46:51.625 --> 00:46:53.416
You could've just called
and said you changed your mind.

00:46:53.875 --> 00:46:55.208
I rushed all the way from London…

00:46:55.625 --> 00:46:56.791
just to head back alone?

00:46:57.041 --> 00:46:58.416
Rohan, please don't push me.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.833
We can't be together.

00:47:00.375 --> 00:47:01.333
Why not?

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.458
Jhinuk!

00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:15.833
My friend likes you.

00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:18.166
Friend?

00:47:18.916 --> 00:47:19.875
Which friend?

00:47:27.291 --> 00:47:28.250
Just reply to her.

00:47:28.666 --> 00:47:29.625
She's waiting.

00:47:35.458 --> 00:47:36.500
You'll get me in trouble.

00:47:44.083 --> 00:47:45.250
Hello? Sir, hi.

00:47:45.625 --> 00:47:48.208
Hey, Bombay Boy. What's going on?
Did you become a composer?

00:47:48.375 --> 00:47:51.666
Nothing, just making music for ads.

00:47:51.916 --> 00:47:52.916
What?

00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:54.750
Just to survive.

00:47:55.625 --> 00:47:56.916
I get some money out of it.

00:47:57.416 --> 00:47:58.875
If you're having money problems,
come back.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:01.791
We have a senior developer job open.

00:48:02.291 --> 00:48:04.125
Just thought I should ask our guy before
the interviews start.

00:48:05.208 --> 00:48:06.708
Oh, okay.

00:48:07.333 --> 00:48:08.708
It comes with a 20% hike.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.541
Thank you. Okay.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.791
Think about it and call me.

00:48:20.625 --> 00:48:22.125
I have no idea what he's up to.

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:24.791
Look, it just keeps showing "typing."

00:48:25.166 --> 00:48:26.166
Just call him already.

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.250
If he wanted to talk,
he would've called.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.000
Why the ego, Man?

00:48:30.458 --> 00:48:31.875
It's not ego.

00:48:33.083 --> 00:48:36.833
Some things are just hard
to say on a call.

00:48:37.208 --> 00:48:38.791
It's easier over text.

00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:40.291
That's probably
why he's messaging.

00:48:40.375 --> 00:48:43.333
Shruti, stop forgetting your lunch!

00:48:44.041 --> 00:48:45.125
Oh! Thank you so much.

00:48:45.208 --> 00:48:46.250
I will pick you up at 8:00 a.m.

00:48:46.333 --> 00:48:47.250
Hello? Hey, bro.

00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:48.708
Listen, Parth.

00:48:48.958 --> 00:48:50.291
Bro, enough with the suspense.

00:48:50.375 --> 00:48:51.625
You've been typing forever.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:54.833
-Wait, are you with Shruti?
-I'm always so forgetful

00:48:54.916 --> 00:48:56.250
Yeah. Want me to hand the phone to her?

00:48:57.375 --> 00:49:00.083
No.
No, I'll talk to you later.

00:49:00.416 --> 00:49:03.125
-They're calling me inside.
-Okay.

00:49:03.208 --> 00:49:04.291
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:05.416
Bye.

00:49:12.291 --> 00:49:13.791
Lunch exchange.

00:49:15.041 --> 00:49:16.208
So, he's the single father?

00:49:17.666 --> 00:49:18.583
Yeah.

00:49:19.791 --> 00:49:20.875
What?

00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:22.125
Nothing.

00:49:23.625 --> 00:49:24.708
Say something.

00:49:24.916 --> 00:49:25.958
See, my logic is pretty simple.

00:49:26.125 --> 00:49:27.666
Everyone deserves to be happy.

00:49:27.875 --> 00:49:29.250
Do whatever it takes
to make that happen.

00:49:29.458 --> 00:49:30.916
Just don't hurt anyone in the process.

00:49:36.916 --> 00:49:38.666
I think I really like this guy.

00:49:42.291 --> 00:49:44.208
He's got a ton of responsibilities,

00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:47.583
but he's still so sorted,
not boring at all, and he's really…

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:49.250
Parth!

00:49:50.083 --> 00:49:51.000
Parth!

00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:55.750
Sorry.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.666
Modern love is so confusing.

00:50:18.875 --> 00:50:22.416
It's like a cheese Chinese
Schezwan masala dosa.

00:50:22.791 --> 00:50:24.791
It's got stuff from Chennai
all the way to China,

00:50:24.875 --> 00:50:26.583
but doesn't really belong anywhere.

00:50:40.458 --> 00:50:42.208
Please don't laugh.

00:50:42.666 --> 00:50:44.041
Don't make me more embarrassed
than I already am.

00:50:46.416 --> 00:50:47.625
So, where are you originally from,
Delhi or Bangalore?

00:50:47.958 --> 00:50:49.208
Actually, Pune.

00:50:49.625 --> 00:50:51.208
But I work in Delhi.

00:50:51.458 --> 00:50:53.708
And my company's
headquarter is in Bangalore.

00:50:53.791 --> 00:50:55.250
-Oh, got it.
-So, I have to go there once a year.

00:50:55.458 --> 00:50:56.500
That's when…

00:50:58.458 --> 00:50:59.458
You?

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:02.125
You do theater, right?

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.458
Homework!

00:51:06.458 --> 00:51:08.416
I just do theater to pass the time.

00:51:08.625 --> 00:51:11.166
I'm actually currently working
on the stabilization

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:13.458
of the follicular cells
for the epitherial…

00:51:13.708 --> 00:51:14.708
Okay, I get it.

00:51:14.791 --> 00:51:18.125
Basically, I'm trying to find a way
to permanently remove men's chest hair.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:20.000
You like a clean chest?
What is your thing?

00:51:20.166 --> 00:51:22.791
The doors will open on your left.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:24.250
I'm in HR.

00:51:24.625 --> 00:51:25.583
Human Remorse?

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:27.458
Hit and Run?

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:28.708
Hardly Relevant?

00:51:31.666 --> 00:51:32.541
Sorry.

00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:36.500
You and your beau work together?

00:51:37.166 --> 00:51:38.083
Yeah.

00:51:38.666 --> 00:51:40.458
Actually, I'm engaged.

00:51:40.666 --> 00:51:41.791
We're getting married soon.

00:51:41.916 --> 00:51:42.875
Why are you getting married?

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.416
I like being with him.

00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:49.250
He's like my comfort zone.

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.500
In behavioral psychology, that's
called the "house slippers syndrome".

00:51:54.791 --> 00:51:56.750
-What?
-You know house slippers?

00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:58.208
They're all worn out,

00:51:59.041 --> 00:52:00.083
but we still wear them.

00:52:00.916 --> 00:52:02.250
Because they're comfy.

00:52:02.333 --> 00:52:03.375
We're used to them.

00:52:04.583 --> 00:52:05.875
And we don't toss them out

00:52:06.416 --> 00:52:07.708
until they make us slip and fall.

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.416
So, why are you here?

00:52:14.916 --> 00:52:15.791
Sex--

00:52:15.916 --> 00:52:19.416
Explore the unexplored.
And you?

00:52:21.916 --> 00:52:24.458
To catch--
I'm looking for something.

00:52:43.958 --> 00:52:46.750
You wrote that letter, right?

00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:49.666
I like you too.

00:52:57.041 --> 00:52:59.333
Look, what's this?
How'd it become black?

00:52:59.416 --> 00:53:00.666
It'll come out.

00:53:00.791 --> 00:53:03.875
So this is the lifeline.

00:53:09.708 --> 00:53:11.125
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:53:11.875 --> 00:53:13.416
-Are you busy?
-No, go ahead.

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:14.958
I've been messaging you for a while.

00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:17.625
Sorry, I missed them.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.333
Are you okay?
What is it?

00:53:19.458 --> 00:53:20.375
Yeah…

00:53:21.083 --> 00:53:24.166
Well, Sameer called.

00:53:24.916 --> 00:53:26.958
He's offering me a promotion
with a 20% hike.

00:53:27.458 --> 00:53:28.875
He wants an answer by tonight.

00:53:30.541 --> 00:53:31.583
So what did you say?

00:53:33.125 --> 00:53:34.291
Nothing's really working out, Shruti.

00:53:37.208 --> 00:53:39.208
I'm making jingles for damn iron rods.

00:53:39.833 --> 00:53:40.875
I'm just done.

00:53:43.041 --> 00:53:46.625
Here, everything runs on contacts,
and I don't have any.

00:53:49.041 --> 00:53:49.958
What are you looking at?

00:53:51.583 --> 00:53:52.458
No one.

00:53:53.666 --> 00:53:54.625
So, what have you decided?

00:53:57.791 --> 00:53:59.083
I think I should take the job.

00:54:00.041 --> 00:54:01.041
What do you think?

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:04.583
You've already made up your mind.
Why ask me?

00:54:05.333 --> 00:54:07.500
Shruti, I'm asking
because it should be our decision.

00:54:07.583 --> 00:54:11.041
No, it's your decision,
and it's the right one.

00:54:11.125 --> 00:54:12.041
It's practical.

00:54:14.375 --> 00:54:15.250
What about you?

00:54:15.333 --> 00:54:18.166
Me? I'll stay in Delhi.

00:54:18.916 --> 00:54:20.375
I'm getting a promotion too.

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:23.375
You did the right thing by quitting.

00:54:23.791 --> 00:54:27.250
You were right
when you said you're average.

00:54:28.041 --> 00:54:29.083
Like your father.

00:54:30.291 --> 00:54:31.708
You know what your problem is?

00:54:31.958 --> 00:54:34.958
You don't know
what you want from life.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.041
I'll talk to you later.

00:54:37.125 --> 00:54:38.166
I have to go.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:50.125
Is Maya your real name?

00:54:51.833 --> 00:54:55.500
Nope. What about you?
Are you actually a wing commander?

00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:57.208
No.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.500
At least with fake names,
we can be real here.

00:55:02.583 --> 00:55:07.583
True. I can tell you things I'd never say
to my husband.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.375
Hello, my sweetheart!

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:21.958
Hey, Auntie, are you free?

00:55:22.125 --> 00:55:23.500
For you, I'm always free.

00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:26.791
You know, my friend Anaya…

00:55:27.041 --> 00:55:29.166
She's pretty confused.

00:55:29.541 --> 00:55:32.916
She can't figure out
if she's straight or not.

00:55:33.291 --> 00:55:37.916
{\an8}It's a confusion caused by the internet.

00:55:38.833 --> 00:55:42.208
{\an8}At the young age of 15,
you guys have already seen

00:55:42.625 --> 00:55:44.208
{\an8}things we might not have even seen by 25.

00:55:44.291 --> 00:55:46.416
Please just tell me, she's really upset.

00:55:46.541 --> 00:55:48.041
Tell her not to worry.

00:55:48.958 --> 00:55:51.666
One figures it out when the time is right.

00:55:52.791 --> 00:55:53.708
But…

00:55:54.458 --> 00:55:57.958
how will she know?
I mean, how will she officially know?

00:55:58.833 --> 00:55:59.791
It's very simple.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.375
One day, she'll kiss a girl,

00:56:02.875 --> 00:56:05.166
and if she feels
butterflies in her stomach,

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.125
then she likes girls.

00:56:07.916 --> 00:56:09.916
And if, while kissing a boy,

00:56:10.083 --> 00:56:12.416
she feels like she's floating,

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:13.875
then she's straight.

00:56:14.208 --> 00:56:15.083
Or maybe both.

00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:17.708
But your "friend" will figure it out.

00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:20.541
But, Auntie, this is…

00:56:21.583 --> 00:56:22.541
What about science?

00:56:22.833 --> 00:56:24.083
Baby, kiss test.

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:25.958
It's the oldest science there is.

00:56:26.625 --> 00:56:29.333
Pihu, you'll know when the time is right.

00:56:29.416 --> 00:56:31.208
Okay? Just chill out.

00:56:31.375 --> 00:56:32.333
Okay, bye.

00:56:33.125 --> 00:56:34.125
Bye.

00:56:39.333 --> 00:56:40.375
Jhinuk!

00:56:44.958 --> 00:56:46.791
This is your interview letter.

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.416
My university wants to interview you.

00:56:51.791 --> 00:56:52.708
Don't do it for me…

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:56.250
do it for yourself.

00:57:00.375 --> 00:57:01.500
Take care.

00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:03.958
Jhinuk, I love you!

00:57:04.625 --> 00:57:05.666
And I know you love me too.

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:07.916
I wouldn't insist if you were
truly happy here. Jhinuk!

00:57:10.208 --> 00:57:11.583
College reunion?

00:57:11.833 --> 00:57:13.583
What's even the point of going?
Waste of time.

00:57:14.375 --> 00:57:16.250
People are just going to stand around

00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:18.916
and boast about their lives.

00:57:19.666 --> 00:57:21.375
No, my friends aren't like that.

00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:23.125
You don't have to come, I'll go on my own.

00:57:23.208 --> 00:57:24.166
On your own?

00:57:24.291 --> 00:57:26.125
When was the last time
you went anywhere alone?

00:57:27.583 --> 00:57:29.000
Have you ever given me the chance?

00:57:29.166 --> 00:57:30.166
Don't make this bigger than it is.

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.333
You're not going, that's final.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.875
Chumki's getting married in two months.

00:57:33.958 --> 00:57:35.083
We've got a lot to take care of.

00:57:39.166 --> 00:57:42.041
For centuries. Time and again.

00:57:43.083 --> 00:57:44.375
This is what happens, my friend,

00:57:44.791 --> 00:57:46.541
when the foolish reign.

00:57:47.458 --> 00:57:49.333
When the undeserved bark commands.

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:51.416
The head helplessly bows low.

00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.583
While a silent, trembling
anger starts to glow.

00:57:55.291 --> 00:57:56.333
I knew you'd come.

00:57:57.041 --> 00:57:58.000
There's something rare between us two.

00:58:00.708 --> 00:58:04.291
When hands that hold
the sun align to create,

00:58:04.791 --> 00:58:06.500
that's when this happens.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:14.583
You wrote this play?

00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:16.500
Be honest.

00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:19.041
Come on, madam,

00:58:19.125 --> 00:58:21.125
you barely know me.

00:58:22.208 --> 00:58:24.125
Take your time,
get to know me bit by bit.

00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:25.666
I'm like an onion,
lots of layers to go through.

00:58:26.375 --> 00:58:27.375
Tell me something…

00:58:28.291 --> 00:58:29.375
do I have a chance?

00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:32.791
Do I have a chance?

00:58:33.166 --> 00:58:34.041
No.

00:58:34.125 --> 00:58:36.208
-What?
-No chance at all.

00:58:36.291 --> 00:58:38.666
So there's no point trying
to impress you?

00:58:39.333 --> 00:58:40.333
Sure?

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.666
-Is that final?
-Yes.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:45.291
Alright then, let's just get drunk
and enjoy the night.

00:58:45.416 --> 00:58:46.875
I can't drink.

00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:49.000
I lose control. I turn into a mess.

00:58:49.083 --> 00:58:50.833
Nobody drinks to stay in control.

00:58:51.416 --> 00:58:52.583
And history will vouch,

00:58:52.666 --> 00:58:54.708
I don't take advantage
of drunk women, okay?

00:58:54.875 --> 00:58:56.625
-Excuse me, sir. Order please.
-No? Okay.

00:58:56.875 --> 00:58:59.083
-Just one beer and a Coke.
-Okay.

00:58:59.333 --> 00:59:00.291
Yes.

00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:02.708
With Old Monk.

00:59:03.125 --> 00:59:04.041
Okay.

00:59:06.291 --> 00:59:07.625
I am dying to meet you.

00:59:09.666 --> 00:59:10.916
Me too.

00:59:12.666 --> 00:59:13.708
Can we meet now?

00:59:15.208 --> 00:59:17.125
Sure. Where?

00:59:19.791 --> 00:59:22.833
Bombay Coffee House?
It's two minutes from my place.

00:59:23.583 --> 00:59:24.458
Oh,

00:59:24.541 --> 00:59:30.416
if I jump from my balcony,
I'll land right in front of it.

00:59:31.291 --> 00:59:32.666
Perfect. See you then.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:34.750
Can't wait!

00:59:39.541 --> 00:59:40.791
Hello? Heart attack?

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.458
I'm coming.
Wait for me outside the ICU.

00:59:43.583 --> 00:59:44.541
I'm on my way.

00:59:49.416 --> 00:59:50.958
-Yeah.
-Tell me.

00:59:51.083 --> 00:59:52.666
-What?
-What's your run rate?

00:59:53.416 --> 00:59:58.083
How many affairs do you have
in a year?

00:59:58.166 --> 01:00:00.833
Around three to four, even
if I don't want them…

01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:02.750
-they just happen.
-Wow!

01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:06.208
-What?
-And with all of them…

01:00:08.833 --> 01:00:09.958
You sleep with all of them?

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:11.916
You're fun when you're drunk!

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.333
-That's what everyone says.
-Crazy.

01:00:13.416 --> 01:00:15.625
-Come on, spill it.
-What? Yeah!

01:00:16.166 --> 01:00:17.166
Otherwise, what's the point?

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:19.708
I mean, you must have been
in love before, right?

01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:22.875
With someone, somewhere?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:23.958
But how do you even know that's love?

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:25.666
What do you mean?

01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:28.875
This feeling…

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:30.916
Your heart's racing,

01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:32.416
you can't sleep, you're not hungry…

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.916
is that love or just indigestion?

01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:36.250
What?!

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:37.791
-You know what I'm saying?
-No.

01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:39.166
Say I do fall in love,

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:42.666
how do I know she's the one?

01:00:42.833 --> 01:00:43.708
Like-- Okay,

01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:46.125
how did you know
that Anand was the one?

01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:50.375
See, you took a pause.

01:00:52.541 --> 01:00:53.583
Come over to my house.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:57.083
Meet my parents,
my sister, and her husband…

01:00:57.875 --> 01:00:59.333
They are so happy.

01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:01.625
They seem so happy in their marriage.

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.125
Maybe they're just pretending.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.708
Look, from what I've seen,
the one thing marriage is sure

01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:07.208
to teach you is acting.

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:13.833
Like a wild wind
Like a kite with no strings

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.041
Set it free and watch how it swings

01:01:16.208 --> 01:01:17.666
-It's mischievous, it's naughty
-Hi. Where are you?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.083
I can see you.

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.291
-It'll kill me one day.
-You have worn a blue shirt, right?

01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:24.541
It forgets its promises
It forgets old memories

01:01:24.708 --> 01:01:27.125
It got excited and lost all its senses

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:28.125
Like a sweet melody

01:01:28.208 --> 01:01:30.291
-Like a wet bar of soap
-Why can't I see you?

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:31.916
It slips and slides right through my hand

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.208
Sorry. My husband is here.

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:37.375
-I had to leave.
-Here it goes again

01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:42.083
-My heart slips once again
-Safety first.

01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:45.208
But now that I have seen you,
I can't wait to meet you.

01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:47.708
In private. Just the two of us.

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:52.125
And my days fade to gray

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:09.916
{\an8}So Anand didn't stand a chance
if he wasn't from Pune!

01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:11.416
Yeah, so?

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.958
-Love also needs a little bit of planning.
-Planning!

01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:16.500
-Everything is about planning for you.
-Yes!

01:02:16.583 --> 01:02:19.333
-First love, then marriage, then kids.
-Yes.

01:02:19.416 --> 01:02:22.041
See, at the end of the day,
the bottom line is reproduction.

01:02:22.666 --> 01:02:23.750
What do you say?

01:02:23.916 --> 01:02:25.833
-Everything's about sex.
-What?!

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.916
Dating, waiting, marriage
Infatuation, heartbreak blues

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.333
Love and all, they are just excuses

01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:36.500
Everything's about sex

01:02:36.583 --> 01:02:37.875
Nonsense.

01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:39.166
Shut up.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:40.583
That's all this is about

01:02:40.666 --> 01:02:41.916
It is a dessert.

01:02:42.041 --> 01:02:44.583
-Love is the main course
-You're mistaken

01:02:44.666 --> 01:02:47.208
-I want…
-Indigestion.

01:02:47.291 --> 01:02:49.958
-Happy ending
-Happy ending

01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:51.666
To my love story

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.375
I want a happy ending too,

01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:54.416
but just the kind you get
at a massage parlor.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.916
Stop being so childish, okay?

01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:58.708
-I will, on one condition
-What?

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:03.583
You leave Anand,
and I'll stop being childish, okay?

01:03:03.708 --> 01:03:05.375
What do you know about him?

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.500
Not much.

01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:08.833
He shrugs, always in doubt

01:03:08.958 --> 01:03:11.333
"I don't know, maybe, perhaps"

01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:16.708
He's always so confused
He's got nothing figured out

01:03:16.791 --> 01:03:18.166
Will you just shut up?

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:19.375
Doesn't he shrug his shoulders?

01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:20.458
He does, so?

01:03:20.666 --> 01:03:23.083
He is what you call
an "I don't know" guy.

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:25.541
When you'll need him the most,

01:03:25.791 --> 01:03:28.875
he'll just shrug and say,
"I don't know," and walk away.

01:03:28.958 --> 01:03:30.791
He says, "I don't know!"

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:32.333
Are you very smart?

01:03:32.416 --> 01:03:33.333
You're not.

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:36.666
You're a commitment-phobic man-child!

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:38.125
You're scared. You're a coward!

01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:39.083
That's why…

01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:40.916
you play with other people's emotions!

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Because you can't even face your own.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.333
A cowardly man-child.

01:03:45.833 --> 01:03:50.166
The day you meet the right girl,
all your ideas

01:03:50.375 --> 01:03:52.250
will leave your system, just like that.

01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:55.125
Then we'll meet and we'll talk.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.250
Here it goes again

01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:08.291
My heart slips once again

01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:13.833
My nights slip away

01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:19.666
{\an8}And my days fade to gray

01:04:47.166 --> 01:04:49.000
Kajol, stop it.
You're overstretching this.

01:04:49.083 --> 01:04:51.750
No, I want to see how far he'll go.

01:04:55.208 --> 01:04:56.125
Just see that.

01:04:56.708 --> 01:04:57.666
What the--

01:04:58.583 --> 01:04:59.875
She wants to meet.

01:05:00.208 --> 01:05:01.166
She wants to meet?

01:05:01.333 --> 01:05:02.250
At a hotel?

01:05:02.708 --> 01:05:03.625
At a hotel.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:04.666
Online?

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:06.041
Online.

01:05:06.458 --> 01:05:07.333
Since when?

01:05:08.791 --> 01:05:10.125
I can't believe he got a match!

01:05:10.291 --> 01:05:11.458
Not just a match. Matches.

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.583
In eight months,
I've got seven catches.

01:05:13.708 --> 01:05:15.000
How?!

01:05:15.291 --> 01:05:16.250
This is wrong

01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:19.291
This is so wrong, Monty

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.916
You're married

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.666
Yet you sneak around fancy-free

01:05:25.958 --> 01:05:28.166
I stayed within the limits defined

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.791
-I never crossed the line
-No.

01:05:29.958 --> 01:05:34.958
I've built many castles in the air
But I've never entered them

01:05:35.208 --> 01:05:39.791
I hid these tunes in my mind
But I never play them on the flute

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:45.750
How long are you going
To play your flute all alone?

01:05:45.958 --> 01:05:50.500
At some point, you'll have to let someone
Else have a go, too

01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:55.875
Why settle for being a henpecked husband?

01:05:56.583 --> 01:06:01.166
The grass is greener on the other side
Time to give it a try

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:06.416
We live and die for our wives and kids

01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:11.791
The least we deserve is
The joy of cheating

01:06:12.541 --> 01:06:15.000
Issue such a license or permit

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:17.916
That lets married guys cheat without guilt

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:32.375
My heart does as it wants

01:06:33.583 --> 01:06:37.291
It doesn't know how to follow
A straight path

01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:43.333
It chases its own delusion

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:48.750
Belongs to me, yet ignores my inclusion

01:06:49.541 --> 01:06:54.541
Here it slips and falls once more

01:06:54.833 --> 01:06:59.791
It doesn't know how to stop anymore

01:07:00.291 --> 01:07:05.333
It falls, topples, rises, and soars

01:07:05.541 --> 01:07:10.833
It's helpless by nature, wanting more

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.250
I'm in the shower.

01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:23.958
The door's open.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.916
Please, come on in.

01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:58.875
Listen, I'm not dressed.

01:07:58.958 --> 01:08:01.750
Can you turn around
and close your eyes, please?

01:08:03.916 --> 01:08:04.958
Are your eyes closed?

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.541
-Yes. Done.
-Come.

01:08:13.875 --> 01:08:15.541
Hey, what are you doing?

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:18.208
-Keep quiet.
-I'm getting nervous.

01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:19.666
-No, no, no.
-Yes!

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.958
You seem pretty excited.

01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:23.750
-No, no, no.
-Two minutes.

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.958
-I can't…
-Please keep quiet.

01:08:26.708 --> 01:08:28.041
Please don't do it.

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:29.708
Please don't do it…
Do it, do it.

01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:31.041
-Do…
-Naughty.

01:08:31.125 --> 01:08:32.125
What are you doing?

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.500
Don't you trust me?

01:08:33.708 --> 01:08:35.333
There it goes, my pants are off.

01:08:35.416 --> 01:08:36.500
What's the fun in keeping them on?

01:08:36.583 --> 01:08:38.166
It's fun for me.

01:08:41.541 --> 01:08:42.916
-Let's go.
-Where are you taking me?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.208
Don't take me to the washroom.

01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:45.958
I'm taking you to heaven.

01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:47.250
-Heaven?
-Just come with me.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.875
-Darling, your voice is so sexy.
-I know.

01:08:49.958 --> 01:08:51.000
Just show me your face.

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:53.708
-I'm not so adventurous.
-Come on.

01:08:53.791 --> 01:08:56.250
Let's talk first.

01:08:57.416 --> 01:08:58.541
No, I…

01:08:58.916 --> 01:09:00.666
I mean…

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:02.958
Let's talk first, then we can…

01:09:03.041 --> 01:09:07.041
You see, I've never been naked
with anyone other than my wife.

01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:09.041
-So, I'm feeling a little nervous.
-Let's go.

01:09:09.166 --> 01:09:10.083
Hello?

01:09:10.583 --> 01:09:11.458
Hello?

01:09:41.833 --> 01:09:42.750
Stop.

01:09:43.833 --> 01:09:44.708
Wait.

01:09:44.791 --> 01:09:46.250
-My keys!
-Yes, sir.

01:09:56.541 --> 01:10:00.000
What about this heart?

01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:05.375
What about my heart?

01:10:05.958 --> 01:10:11.041
If your feelings matter

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:13.458
Then…

01:10:13.583 --> 01:10:17.833
-Don't mine too?
-I am feeling sleepy. Let's go, Papa.

01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:21.666
-What about this heart?
-Come.

01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:26.750
What about my heart?

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:44.541
What about this heart?

01:10:44.666 --> 01:10:50.250
What about my heart?

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:51.833
Sorry, I'm still at work.

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:54.333
I'll call you once I get home. Bye.

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:55.541
Want me to drop you off at home?

01:10:55.625 --> 01:10:57.625
No, my friend will pick me up.
Sorry. Bye.

01:11:00.666 --> 01:11:05.750
Last time I saw you, you were right here

01:11:05.833 --> 01:11:10.916
Then I turned around
And you were no longer there

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:16.291
Why do you feel so far
Even though you're mine?

01:11:16.375 --> 01:11:19.208
Tell me why?

01:11:21.916 --> 01:11:24.708
-Teach me how to love you
-Hold the lift.

01:11:24.791 --> 01:11:25.750
Where are you going?

01:11:26.375 --> 01:11:27.250
Grandma's house.

01:11:27.333 --> 01:11:30.583
Or teach me how to live without you

01:11:30.666 --> 01:11:32.041
Papa, your tag…

01:11:32.541 --> 01:11:35.125
-Why do you feel so far
-Move!

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:37.666
Even though you're mine?

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:41.458
-Tell me why?
-Mom! What are you doing?!

01:11:42.958 --> 01:11:46.916
What about my heart?

01:11:47.208 --> 01:11:52.041
What about my heart?

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:58.916
If your heart is a heart, then
My heart is also a heart, isn't it?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.041
Hello? Hi!

01:12:00.125 --> 01:12:02.500
I'm just stepping out of the washroom.
I'll call you in two minutes.

01:12:02.625 --> 01:12:03.791
Okay, bye-bye.

01:12:04.416 --> 01:12:05.375
Bye.

01:12:15.541 --> 01:12:16.458
Akash.

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:26.416
Where were you?

01:12:26.958 --> 01:12:29.500
-Actually…
-You lied.

01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:32.416
-No.
-You should've told me…

01:12:34.208 --> 01:12:35.250
you were with him.

01:12:35.833 --> 01:12:37.000
If I hadn't called,

01:12:38.375 --> 01:12:39.666
you'd have spent the night with him.

01:12:40.625 --> 01:12:42.041
-Akash!
-How long has this been going on?

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:43.500
What are you saying, Akash?

01:12:43.666 --> 01:12:45.083
He's Parth, our…

01:12:48.666 --> 01:12:50.000
What are you doing?

01:12:50.125 --> 01:12:51.541
-Don't act…
-Listen.

01:12:51.666 --> 01:12:52.708
-Stay out of this!
-Akash!

01:12:52.791 --> 01:12:53.833
Listen to me.

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.541
-Get lost!
-Akash.

01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:59.375
-I told you to stay out of this!
-You wanna fight?

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:00.875
-You--
-Best friend, my foot!

01:13:00.958 --> 01:13:02.958
-You're not my friend! You jerk!
-Let him go, Akash!

01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:04.208
You're sleeping with my wife!

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:06.250
What nonsense!

01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:07.625
This is not nonsense.

01:13:08.708 --> 01:13:10.000
I've been working hard in Mumbai.

01:13:11.375 --> 01:13:13.583
And you two are just playing around here.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.166
She's guilt-tripping me.

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.750
Guilt of long distance, sacrifice…

01:13:22.541 --> 01:13:24.625
I don't even know if that baby was mine.

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:30.041
What are you trying to say?

01:13:31.041 --> 01:13:32.833
Do you even know
what you're saying?

01:13:32.916 --> 01:13:34.666
-I don't know.
-You have gone mad.

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:37.333
-You have gone crazy.
-What?

01:13:37.416 --> 01:13:38.708
What did you just say?

01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:40.166
Look at your state!

01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:44.041
Don't freaking touch me!

01:13:44.458 --> 01:13:45.375
Stay away!

01:13:46.666 --> 01:13:48.916
You're blaming me?

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.500
I can't believe it!

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:53.458
First your Dad,

01:13:54.083 --> 01:13:56.916
then Bombay, and now the baby.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.083
You're going to blame the baby
that wasn't even born?

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:05.458
Let me go.

01:14:09.208 --> 01:14:10.291
Once a loser,

01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:12.333
always a loser.

01:14:13.958 --> 01:14:17.458
You will die a failure.

01:14:17.666 --> 01:14:22.708
Why did you leave me?
Break me so carelessly?

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:26.333
I've fallen apart

01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:33.333
My rotten luck took me away from you

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:37.416
Maybe there's something wrong with me

01:14:37.583 --> 01:14:41.166
Why does every pore in me cry?

01:14:41.291 --> 01:14:42.875
Why have I lost

01:14:42.958 --> 01:14:48.125
Every reason to live and die?

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:54.208
Why have I carved you deep in my heart

01:14:54.958 --> 01:15:01.791
I only wanted to make you mine
From the start

01:15:02.083 --> 01:15:03.208
I need to go to Mumbai.

01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:07.708
I need to be with him.

01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:09.791
Even after what he did today?

01:15:10.083 --> 01:15:11.541
He crossed the line today, Shruti.

01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:13.083
I crossed the line too.

01:15:13.666 --> 01:15:14.958
We all do at some point.

01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:16.583
That doesn't mean

01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:18.958
we just give up on each other.

01:15:20.041 --> 01:15:22.583
You two have such a toxic kind of love.
I just don't get it.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.041
You won't get it.

01:15:25.958 --> 01:15:28.083
-What?
-You won't understand.

01:15:29.166 --> 01:15:30.208
Tell me,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.625
what do you even know
about love and relationships?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.708
-I know enough--
-You don't know anything.

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:38.958
And honestly,

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:40.916
I don't expect you
to understand either.

01:15:57.875 --> 01:16:01.583
I've been knocking forever.
Why weren't you opening the door?

01:16:03.291 --> 01:16:04.541
My jacket…

01:16:05.625 --> 01:16:08.083
-Papa, are you drunk?
-Yes, I'm drunk.

01:16:08.166 --> 01:16:09.083
So what?

01:16:09.666 --> 01:16:12.125
Stop poking your nose into everything!

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.166
Last time I saw you
You were right here

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:25.333
Then I turned around
And you were no longer there

01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:30.625
Why can I not have you
After having you so close?

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:33.666
Can you please tell me?

01:16:36.208 --> 01:16:41.541
Tell me how I should love you true

01:16:41.625 --> 01:16:46.916
Or come and teach me how
To live without you

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.041
Why can I not have you
After having you so close?

01:16:52.125 --> 01:16:57.583
Can you please tell me?

01:16:57.666 --> 01:17:02.833
-I am lost, I am broken
-Ma!

01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:04.208
Is she upstairs?

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:08.291
I feel like my soul's been silently stolen

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:13.375
I'm upset with myself, just like you

01:17:13.458 --> 01:17:17.458
My story's almost through

01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:22.625
You are going to leave anyway, too

01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:25.375
What about this heart?

01:17:25.625 --> 01:17:28.000
What about my heart?

01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:32.958
If your heart is a heart, then

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:40.375
My heart is also a heart, is it not?

01:17:41.666 --> 01:17:46.458
What about this heart?

01:17:46.833 --> 01:17:49.375
What about my heart?

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:54.625
If your heart is a heart, then

01:17:54.750 --> 01:18:01.083
My heart is also a heart, is it not?

01:18:05.541 --> 01:18:10.416
What about my heart?

01:18:10.875 --> 01:18:15.541
If your heart is a heart, then

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.416
My heart is also a heart, is it not?

01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:25.500
-Bye.
-Bye, Mom.

01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:26.708
Love you.

01:18:26.916 --> 01:18:28.291
-Have a safe trip.
-Hi, Papa!

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:29.250
Hi.

01:18:31.166 --> 01:18:32.791
-I missed you, Papa.
-Missed you too.

01:18:34.083 --> 01:18:34.958
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:18:35.083 --> 01:18:36.541
-Bye!
-Go on, go.

01:18:36.875 --> 01:18:38.333
-Bye!
-Bye!

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:49.625
Bro, he's right there.

01:18:51.416 --> 01:18:55.083
Papa, you didn't visit Pune even once
in the past three months.

01:18:55.416 --> 01:18:56.583
I really missed you.

01:18:57.208 --> 01:18:58.750
Papa, you're not trying your best.

01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:03.291
If Mumma moves to Pune,
I'll have to change schools.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.333
When I come back,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.291
promise me you both
will pick me up together. Okay?

01:19:12.666 --> 01:19:13.583
You good?

01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:22.208
Guddu.

01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:28.666
Sir, sir, Akash Arya here.

01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:29.708
Not now, afterwards.

01:19:29.791 --> 01:19:30.791
-I'm a musician, sir.
-Afterwards.

01:19:30.875 --> 01:19:32.500
-He said, "Not now."
-Sir, I…

01:19:32.583 --> 01:19:34.125
Sir, just a minute. I'm not struggling.

01:19:34.208 --> 01:19:35.541
-Why are you pushing me?
-Leave.

01:19:35.708 --> 01:19:37.041
Get lost.

01:19:46.375 --> 01:19:47.416
Hey.

01:19:47.625 --> 01:19:49.750
I've got some sample invites.
Take a look and pick one.

01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:52.708
-Baba, what's the rush? We'll do it later.
-Here you go.

01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:54.458
-Biscuit?
-Biscuit?

01:19:57.916 --> 01:19:58.791
Where's the biscuit?

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:01.541
Look, your father
isn't letting me go alone.

01:20:01.625 --> 01:20:02.583
To Kolkata?

01:20:02.666 --> 01:20:03.708
Baba, you choose.

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:06.333
Whatever you pick,
I'm sure it'll be perfect.

01:20:10.458 --> 01:20:12.416
Hey, why don't you come with me?

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:13.916
It's just a small reunion.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.458
We'll stay for a couple of days after that
and do some shopping.

01:20:20.375 --> 01:20:21.291
Hey--

01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:23.625
Hey.

01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:28.333
You?

01:20:28.416 --> 01:20:29.291
You?

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:30.416
You…

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:31.833
You're drenched.

01:20:31.916 --> 01:20:32.958
-I'll get you a towel.
-Got drenched.

01:20:33.041 --> 01:20:35.083
Monty? What are you doing here?

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:36.750
-Got drenched.
-Don't come inside.

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:37.708
-Listen to me.
-Please, leave.

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:39.666
-Listen to me. Just listen for a minute.
-Why should I? What is it?

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:41.416
-Talk to me in private. Just for a minute.
-Fine.

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:44.791
Wait, Baba, where are you going?
Finish your tea. Sit, please.

01:20:44.875 --> 01:20:46.000
-Here.
-Finish your tea.

01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:48.708
Why are you giving him a towel?
He's leaving.

01:20:49.166 --> 01:20:50.416
If not for me,

01:20:50.833 --> 01:20:52.041
then forgive me for you.

01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:54.416
Look at the pain you're in.

01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:55.833
I'm not in pain.

01:20:55.916 --> 01:20:57.000
-You're not?
-No.

01:20:57.875 --> 01:20:58.833
Well, I am.

01:21:00.416 --> 01:21:01.916
I think I deserve a second chance.

01:21:02.666 --> 01:21:03.541
What?

01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:05.333
A second chance.

01:21:05.416 --> 01:21:07.291
-A second chance? One minute.
-Hey…

01:21:07.375 --> 01:21:08.291
Kajol…

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:09.375
What?

01:21:09.458 --> 01:21:11.083
After everything you did?
You think you deserve a second chance?

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.375
You really think you deserve
one after all this?

01:21:12.458 --> 01:21:13.375
No, no, Kajol, please…

01:21:13.458 --> 01:21:14.416
Should I post this on the
WhatsApp group?

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:15.375
No, Kajol, don't.

01:21:15.458 --> 01:21:16.500
-Chumki, come here.
-Come with me.

01:21:16.583 --> 01:21:17.875
I want to show you
something very interesting.

01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:19.000
Wait there.
Just stay right there.

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:19.958
Just hear him out.

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.541
-Ma, you don't even know what happened.
-Listen to him.

01:21:21.625 --> 01:21:23.125
At least listen to him once.

01:21:23.208 --> 01:21:24.166
-Why won't you listen?
-What?

01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:25.166
What?

01:21:25.833 --> 01:21:27.541
You're dragging this too far.

01:21:27.625 --> 01:21:28.666
-Am I?
-Yes.

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.833
He admitted he was wrong.
He said sorry, right?

01:21:31.958 --> 01:21:33.125
Give him another chance.

01:21:33.958 --> 01:21:34.916
Wow.

01:21:35.333 --> 01:21:36.416
That's exactly what he said,

01:21:36.833 --> 01:21:38.041
"I deserve a second chance."

01:21:38.125 --> 01:21:39.833
And now you're siding with him.

01:21:39.916 --> 01:21:40.875
He's not wrong.

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.000
In marriage, you have to adjust.

01:21:43.083 --> 01:21:44.041
That's just how it is.

01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:48.458
Oh, like you did?

01:21:52.583 --> 01:21:54.000
By giving Baba a second chance?

01:21:57.750 --> 01:22:01.708
You think I don't know
about Auntie Sheila?

01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:08.666
I was in tenth grade

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:11.333
when you found out about his affair.

01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:13.250
And so did I.

01:22:13.958 --> 01:22:16.333
For a whole year, every other day,

01:22:16.458 --> 01:22:18.083
you'd lock yourself
in the bathroom and cry.

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:21.708
And I'd turn up the TV volume
so Chumki wouldn't hear you.

01:22:23.791 --> 01:22:26.875
You didn't have the courage
to leave him.

01:22:26.958 --> 01:22:28.083
Or leave the house.

01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:40.541
Chumki was just four.

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:45.416
You both were so young, so I…

01:22:45.666 --> 01:22:47.083
For the sake of the kids, I…

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:51.333
How long are you going
to keep hiding behind that excuse?

01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:56.333
At least now admit it
that you never had the courage.

01:22:57.666 --> 01:22:59.583
You know, I never wanted
to turn out like you.

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:04.041
But that's exactly who I've become.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.458
All I think about is family.

01:23:07.666 --> 01:23:10.333
I have no goals, no dreams,
nothing of my own.

01:23:10.625 --> 01:23:12.666
I was supposed to spend my life as a
happy housewife.

01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:14.416
Why?

01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:17.083
Because marriage means
adjusting, right?

01:23:19.125 --> 01:23:20.666
I've become a doormat just like you,

01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:22.416
and I hate myself for it!

01:23:25.208 --> 01:23:27.083
You're getting married, right?
Well, this is what marriage looks like.

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:28.333
Congratulations.

01:23:43.333 --> 01:23:45.083
The fetus is 18 weeks old.

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.708
And by this time, they start
developing very quickly.

01:23:48.458 --> 01:23:51.750
Frankly, you should've made
the decision to terminate long ago.

01:23:54.208 --> 01:23:55.291
I tried…

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
just didn't have the courage.

01:23:59.666 --> 01:24:01.500
You don't have enough time.

01:24:02.333 --> 01:24:04.125
One to two weeks.
Maximum.

01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:07.333
I would say, discuss it with your family.

01:24:07.416 --> 01:24:08.708
Whatever the decision is,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.666
just make very sure it's your choice.

01:24:17.208 --> 01:24:19.000
I…

01:24:20.875 --> 01:24:21.750
One second.

01:24:21.833 --> 01:24:23.125
One second, just a second, Shruti.

01:24:23.666 --> 01:24:24.541
Hello?

01:24:24.666 --> 01:24:26.833
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm here.

01:24:26.916 --> 01:24:27.791
Hello?

01:24:27.875 --> 01:24:30.000
No, sir, please don't say that.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.791
Sir, please.

01:24:31.875 --> 01:24:34.833
Just please listen to it once more.

01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:36.041
It's only a raw mix.

01:24:36.166 --> 01:24:39.875
I'll rework it tonight
and send you a new version.

01:24:39.958 --> 01:24:41.375
Sir, please. Please, sir.

01:24:41.541 --> 01:24:42.541
Instruments are not added yet.

01:24:42.666 --> 01:24:44.416
It's just a matter of…
a few tweaks.

01:24:51.708 --> 01:24:52.625
You were saying something?

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:57.875
No, it's nothing.

01:25:18.708 --> 01:25:19.583
Kajol,

01:25:20.583 --> 01:25:23.458
when a relationship
has lasted for years,

01:25:25.416 --> 01:25:26.500
things like this… they happen.

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:28.125
I…

01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:30.666
I understand your situation.

01:25:31.791 --> 01:25:32.750
Really, Baba?

01:25:33.833 --> 01:25:35.666
You were on the other side
of this situation.

01:25:36.875 --> 01:25:37.791
Right?

01:25:41.041 --> 01:25:42.666
All these years, you've…

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:48.125
You've hated me all these years.

01:25:49.416 --> 01:25:50.708
No, I deserve it, but…

01:25:53.083 --> 01:25:54.458
But you never made me feel it.

01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:56.958
I made a mistake.

01:25:57.958 --> 01:25:59.208
A blunder, actually.

01:26:02.458 --> 01:26:03.375
Monty…

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:07.375
Monty!

01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:10.208
Wait, please.

01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:16.750
Your mother gave me just one chance
to make things right.

01:26:18.333 --> 01:26:21.625
Despite what I did to her.

01:26:26.375 --> 01:26:28.583
She's the only woman
I've ever truly loved.

01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:31.083
You,

01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:32.333
Chumki,

01:26:33.333 --> 01:26:34.250
your mother…

01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:37.750
you're my whole world.
My everything.

01:26:48.333 --> 01:26:49.541
For the first time,

01:26:50.291 --> 01:26:51.416
I'm asking you for something.

01:26:54.708 --> 01:26:57.583
Why don't you go away
for a few days?

01:26:57.708 --> 01:26:59.791
-You know, to talk this through.
-Oh, please.

01:26:59.916 --> 01:27:01.583
Try to sort it out.

01:27:02.291 --> 01:27:04.583
Falling out of love is normal.

01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:07.500
It happens to everyone.

01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:10.000
But no one talks about it.

01:27:11.708 --> 01:27:12.791
That's why,

01:27:13.708 --> 01:27:15.875
in a marriage,
you've got to choose to fall in love

01:27:16.583 --> 01:27:17.958
with the same person…

01:27:20.250 --> 01:27:22.416
over and over again.

01:27:24.333 --> 01:27:27.416
That's the only way it lasts.

01:27:28.083 --> 01:27:29.000
Please,

01:27:29.958 --> 01:27:32.250
just give it a try.

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:34.666
Honestly.

01:27:36.916 --> 01:27:39.250
And if it still doesn't work…

01:27:42.291 --> 01:27:44.833
I'll get you a lawyer.
I'll help you get a divorce.

01:27:46.875 --> 01:27:50.375
But, sweetheart, just one last try.

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:52.666
Please.

01:28:06.916 --> 01:28:09.708
I'm sorry. I lied to you.

01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:14.458
I've done this maybe three, four…

01:28:15.458 --> 01:28:18.041
actually, six, no, seven times.

01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:20.625
But I never crossed the line.

01:28:20.916 --> 01:28:22.041
There was just one time

01:28:22.125 --> 01:28:24.125
she kissed me near my lips,
not on them.

01:28:24.208 --> 01:28:26.041
-Stop the car!
-Don't yell!

01:28:26.125 --> 01:28:27.125
I only got caught because of you.

01:28:27.208 --> 01:28:28.583
-I said, "Stop the car!"
-You set a honey trap!

01:28:28.666 --> 01:28:29.708
If it wasn't for that,
I would have never been caught.

01:28:29.791 --> 01:28:30.791
You have the nerve to say that!

01:28:30.875 --> 01:28:32.958
Unknowingly, I was getting
attracted to you again.

01:28:33.125 --> 01:28:34.750
Bullshit! Pervert!

01:28:34.916 --> 01:28:36.500
Rotten values, disgusting upbringing.

01:28:36.625 --> 01:28:38.291
Oh, and your dad's not a pervert?

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.458
How dare you bring up my dad?
How dare you!

01:28:40.541 --> 01:28:42.291
You stop the car!
Stop the car!

01:28:42.375 --> 01:28:43.666
It was a mistake, Kajol.
Both me and your dad made mistakes.

01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:44.708
-You call it a mistake?
-Yes.

01:28:44.791 --> 01:28:46.666
Seven times?
The same mistake, seven times?

01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:47.666
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:49.000
What mistake?
Tell me what I did!

01:28:49.083 --> 01:28:51.291
Remember when your friend
from London came and you met him?

01:28:51.375 --> 01:28:52.666
You're seriously bringing up
college right now?

01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:54.500
-Something that happened ten years ago?
-Yeah. So?

01:28:54.583 --> 01:28:56.125
You're just digging that up
to justify what you did!

01:28:56.208 --> 01:28:57.166
I didn't follow you back then.

01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:58.541
Otherwise, you would've
been caught too.

01:28:58.625 --> 01:28:59.958
-What were you doing for four hours?
-Just to justify your mistake.

01:29:00.041 --> 01:29:01.541
We had dinner! Just dinner!

01:29:01.625 --> 01:29:04.208
Listen, I don't want to listen!
Stop the car or I swear…

01:29:04.291 --> 01:29:05.458
-Or I will jump!
-Stop! No!

01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:06.666
Stop the car now!

01:29:09.458 --> 01:29:10.333
Ma?

01:29:12.208 --> 01:29:13.291
Ma, I'm going.

01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:16.708
Ma!

01:29:19.541 --> 01:29:23.083
{\an8}Sanjeev, I want to be alone for a while.

01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:28.833
I'm going to the reunion.
I'll be back in two days.

01:29:29.291 --> 01:29:30.833
As I usually come back.

01:29:32.625 --> 01:29:33.541
I'm off, Baba.

01:29:34.041 --> 01:29:36.291
There were times you didn't answer
my calls for a whole week.

01:29:37.083 --> 01:29:39.458
I'm sure you can manage
two days without me.

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:41.583
I keep hearing from the kids.

01:29:41.708 --> 01:29:44.083
Space.

01:29:44.791 --> 01:29:46.583
Maybe that's what I need right now.

01:29:47.333 --> 01:29:48.208
Shibani.

01:30:06.333 --> 01:30:07.916
-Drive next to her.
-Okay.

01:30:08.875 --> 01:30:11.208
-Shall I help you, madam?
-I don't want it. Get going.

01:30:11.291 --> 01:30:13.125
-It must be heavy.
-Get lost.

01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:14.166
Hey!

01:30:14.583 --> 01:30:15.750
-Hey!
-Fools!

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:22.583
{\an8}-Kajol, come on, get in the car.
-I am fine.

01:30:22.833 --> 01:30:23.916
{\an8}It's getting dark.

01:30:24.041 --> 01:30:26.000
{\an8}You can be mad at me
even while sitting inside.

01:30:32.875 --> 01:30:33.791
Ms. Maya?

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:35.833
Is that really you, Ms. Maya?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.416
Oh, my God, I thought so.

01:30:37.708 --> 01:30:39.291
You didn't recognize me?

01:30:39.416 --> 01:30:41.041
I'm Wing Commander Raina.

01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:43.666
Please get in, I'll drop you home.
Come on, let me drop you off at home.

01:30:43.791 --> 01:30:45.666
I don't talk to strangers, sorry.

01:30:47.166 --> 01:30:50.625
Sometimes you can tell strangers
the things you can't tell your loved ones.

01:30:51.041 --> 01:30:52.625
Remember, you texted me
something like that once?

01:30:54.125 --> 01:30:56.000
Two strangers on a path unknown,

01:30:56.208 --> 01:30:58.250
by the end,
we'll surely have a tale to tell.

01:30:58.916 --> 01:30:59.833
Please, come.

01:31:02.125 --> 01:31:03.041
{\an8}Please, get in.

01:31:06.875 --> 01:31:07.791
Come on.

01:31:26.125 --> 01:31:27.083
Kajol?

01:31:27.875 --> 01:31:28.750
Kajol?

01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:31.750
Ms. Maya?

01:31:34.708 --> 01:31:35.625
Tea.

01:31:38.666 --> 01:31:40.416
Could I have some water, Mr. Raina?

01:31:41.166 --> 01:31:42.750
I'll make it rain for you,
just say the word!

01:31:44.458 --> 01:31:48.833
Wow, a miracle!
I'll get it for you right now.

01:31:48.916 --> 01:31:51.583
-Wait here, I'll bring the water.
-Bring water.

01:31:55.333 --> 01:31:57.041
Hey, Kajol?

01:31:57.583 --> 01:31:58.458
Kajol!

01:31:59.666 --> 01:32:00.583
Kajol!

01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:32.083
Babita, my God!

01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:33.458
I'll give it. No, not yet.

01:32:33.541 --> 01:32:35.708
After so long. Come.
Come here, come here.

01:32:35.791 --> 01:32:37.291
My hero, Parimal.

01:32:37.375 --> 01:32:38.916
-Look who's here.
-How are you?

01:32:39.083 --> 01:32:40.666
Who'll listen to my stories now?

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:41.958
Wow! Look who's here!

01:32:42.041 --> 01:32:43.666
-Bani!
-Bani!

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:45.500
Back in the day…

01:32:45.583 --> 01:32:46.708
Come on.

01:32:47.208 --> 01:32:49.958
Now, if you could please sing
our beloved "Majnu" anthem!

01:32:50.041 --> 01:32:51.666
-Oh yes!
-Yes, yes!

01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:55.958
-Stop it, it's been 40 years.
-Please sing.

01:32:56.041 --> 01:32:57.791
I don't remember it.

01:32:57.875 --> 01:32:59.041
You will have to recite it today.

01:32:59.125 --> 01:33:00.958
I don't remember it.
Please!

01:33:23.125 --> 01:33:25.041
Hey, I'm so sorry.

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:26.291
Are you alright?

01:33:27.166 --> 01:33:28.083
Please tell me you're okay.

01:33:28.166 --> 01:33:29.750
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:33:32.208 --> 01:33:37.583
Our eyes have been talking
To each other for eternity

01:33:38.708 --> 01:33:44.500
The movement of our eyelashes begins
To reveal secrets

01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:47.333
Don't ask me about
The condition of my heart

01:33:48.166 --> 01:33:52.000
Day and night, it just wants to

01:33:52.208 --> 01:33:55.791
Love, love, love you. Only you

01:33:55.875 --> 01:33:57.541
Come on, Parimal!

01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:59.125
I don't know.

01:33:59.208 --> 01:34:00.458
We'll sing along.

01:34:00.541 --> 01:34:01.416
Yeah!

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:02.708
Come on!

01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:15.041
Why love, love, love?
Pointless love

01:34:16.916 --> 01:34:18.666
Even my secrets

01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:19.666
You okay?

01:34:22.041 --> 01:34:23.000
{\an8}Aryan.

01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:24.416
I'm Maya.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.250
Maya.

01:34:26.541 --> 01:34:28.333
{\an8}-Maya
-Hi.

01:34:29.958 --> 01:34:32.041
We'll think about tomorrow when it comes

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.958
From afar, why don't we just

01:34:36.083 --> 01:34:40.583
Love, love, love. Pointless love

01:34:42.166 --> 01:34:46.958
My heart loves, loves, loves only you

01:35:07.583 --> 01:35:11.333
Life moves so swiftly

01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:16.958
Come sit with me for another cup of tea

01:35:17.291 --> 01:35:21.333
Life moves so swiftly

01:35:21.791 --> 01:35:26.166
Come sit with me for another cup of tea

01:35:26.833 --> 01:35:31.625
I've had a bypass, my sugar's high

01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:34.083
I eat, sleep, wake up, and live all alone

01:35:34.166 --> 01:35:36.208
My boat's got two holes
And is sinking slowly

01:35:36.291 --> 01:35:39.458
My "oh wow" turned to "oh no"

01:35:40.958 --> 01:35:44.250
My tool's rusted and worn

01:35:44.333 --> 01:35:45.458
Shut up.

01:35:46.208 --> 01:35:48.666
Now I share my feelings
With my old buddies

01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:51.125
And each one revealing
Tales of grief untold

01:35:51.208 --> 01:35:54.916
Life moves so swiftly

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:59.583
Come sit with me for another cup of tea

01:36:01.166 --> 01:36:02.750
Bani, how about you?

01:36:05.416 --> 01:36:10.208
I stayed at home like
A pocket handkerchief, quiet

01:36:10.333 --> 01:36:14.958
Every day, I played the roles
Of mother and wife

01:36:15.458 --> 01:36:19.750
My household became my joy and pride

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:24.666
I lost myself in the routine of life

01:36:25.333 --> 01:36:29.500
Though I have everything for sure

01:36:29.916 --> 01:36:32.083
I still wish and crave more

01:36:32.375 --> 01:36:35.000
But maybe that's not in store

01:36:35.125 --> 01:36:38.708
Life moves so swiftly

01:36:39.666 --> 01:36:43.666
Come sit with me for another cup of tea

01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:49.083
We loved to shop, the four of us

01:36:49.291 --> 01:36:53.833
Sudha, my son, his wife, and I
Oh, those days were a plus

01:36:54.125 --> 01:36:58.625
One day, the four of us split into
Two rickshaws

01:36:58.958 --> 01:37:00.916
Sudha with Aabir

01:37:01.291 --> 01:37:03.708
My daughter-in-law with me
To make us all fit

01:37:04.541 --> 01:37:08.375
A truck broke the divider
Reckless and rash

01:37:08.625 --> 01:37:13.333
It slammed the front rickshaw
With a thunderous crash

01:37:13.416 --> 01:37:14.833
Sudha was killed on the spot

01:37:15.625 --> 01:37:17.833
My son, on the way to the hospital

01:37:19.541 --> 01:37:21.583
An old man left alone to roam

01:37:22.666 --> 01:37:24.458
A young girl widowed far from home

01:37:27.541 --> 01:37:31.166
Why did such a thing have to happen

01:37:31.875 --> 01:37:35.500
I can't say

01:37:36.708 --> 01:37:40.125
We used to make four cups of tea

01:37:40.875 --> 01:37:46.291
Now just two each day

01:37:57.791 --> 01:37:59.958
This is a new initiative I've started.
A theater workshop for kids.

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:01.791
Nice.

01:38:04.833 --> 01:38:05.791
I'm getting married.

01:38:08.875 --> 01:38:09.750
What?

01:38:10.083 --> 01:38:11.416
People change, and so have I.

01:38:13.333 --> 01:38:14.375
Just like that?

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:15.958
Just like that.

01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:17.916
Love marriage?

01:38:18.833 --> 01:38:20.291
Love can happen after marriage, too.

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:24.208
She owns a boutique cafe in Shimla.

01:38:25.166 --> 01:38:26.875
She'll manage the boutique.
I'll handle the cafe.

01:38:27.958 --> 01:38:28.833
So sorted. See.

01:38:29.666 --> 01:38:30.541
Now tell me…

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.291
You said love is the main course,
and the rest is all dessert.

01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:37.083
For her, I'd skip dessert altogether.

01:38:37.791 --> 01:38:39.083
-For her?
-Baby!

01:38:39.166 --> 01:38:40.583
You want to…

01:38:41.208 --> 01:38:43.166
-Actually, no, wait, wait, wait.
-Yeah.

01:38:44.208 --> 01:38:45.458
Hi, baby.

01:39:12.708 --> 01:39:16.458
I'm staying in a rented
apartment in London, uncle.

01:39:17.083 --> 01:39:18.541
I plan to buy my own house in two years.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.416
So, you're well settled there.

01:39:22.875 --> 01:39:23.750
Yes.

01:39:24.583 --> 01:39:27.416
You know, when you,
Aabir, and Jhinuk were in college,

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:33.125
I could never tell
if Jhinuk loved you or Aabir.

01:39:33.208 --> 01:39:37.083
No, Uncle, there was nothing like
that between Jhinuk and me.

01:39:37.166 --> 01:39:39.125
-I know, I know.
-We are just good friends.

01:39:46.208 --> 01:39:48.000
I had a girlfriend in college.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.583
She wanted to wait for me,
but I didn't stop her.

01:39:53.208 --> 01:39:54.208
I let her go.

01:39:54.875 --> 01:39:57.875
Just like you're waiting for Jhinuk,

01:39:58.041 --> 01:40:01.458
and she can't gather the courage
to commit, just like me.

01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:07.041
I know I'm the reason.

01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:08.666
Am I right?

01:40:10.833 --> 01:40:11.750
Uncle,

01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:15.666
Aabir--

01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:17.833
Uncle, before he left us…

01:40:17.958 --> 01:40:20.708
You mean before his death?

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.250
Aabir told Jhinuk…

01:40:29.791 --> 01:40:31.125
to always take care of you.

01:40:32.041 --> 01:40:33.500
That she shouldn't leave you alone.

01:40:34.416 --> 01:40:36.416
Aabir's last words are etched
into Jhinuk's mind,

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:39.208
and they won't leave.

01:40:40.208 --> 01:40:41.666
Then we'll have to get them out, son.

01:40:42.791 --> 01:40:46.166
Otherwise, neither Jhinuk,
nor you, nor I will be happy.

01:40:46.875 --> 01:40:50.125
So keep meeting and talking to her.

01:40:50.875 --> 01:40:52.208
You love her, right?

01:40:53.541 --> 01:40:54.541
Then have some courage.

01:40:55.458 --> 01:40:56.458
Have patience.

01:40:57.166 --> 01:40:59.416
I'm already trying.
You should keep trying, too.

01:41:07.125 --> 01:41:09.000
-Hey, dear.
-Hi, Papa.

01:41:09.416 --> 01:41:11.416
Where is Mumma?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:13.958
Darling…

01:41:15.208 --> 01:41:16.583
She's in the washroom.

01:41:17.583 --> 01:41:20.416
Where are you guys staying,
North Goa or South?

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:21.541
Of course, South.

01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:26.458
Okay, Papa, I have to go. Bye.

01:41:32.625 --> 01:41:34.000
And here we are.

01:41:36.541 --> 01:41:38.166
-I had fun.
-Thanks.

01:41:38.291 --> 01:41:39.875
So, let's meet tomorrow morning?

01:41:40.333 --> 01:41:41.250
-Tomorrow? Again?
-Yeah.

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.000
Thought I'd show you around a bit.

01:41:43.791 --> 01:41:46.208
Actually, I'm busy tomorrow, so…

01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:49.125
-Okay, I got it, yeah.
-Okay.

01:41:50.083 --> 01:41:51.041
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:41:54.291 --> 01:41:59.125
Actually, we can meet
for breakfast tomorrow, if you want.

01:42:00.291 --> 01:42:01.166
At 09:30 a.m.?

01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:02.291
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:42:06.708 --> 01:42:07.666
Pihu!

01:42:07.875 --> 01:42:10.000
Wow, Mom, you look so pretty!

01:42:10.166 --> 01:42:12.333
-Really? You really think so?
-Yes.

01:42:12.416 --> 01:42:13.416
Anyway, are you alright?

01:42:15.833 --> 01:42:17.041
Where are you guys staying?

01:42:17.166 --> 01:42:18.166
North or South?

01:42:18.250 --> 01:42:19.291
North.

01:42:20.208 --> 01:42:21.208
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:42:21.333 --> 01:42:22.666
Where's Papa?

01:42:23.333 --> 01:42:25.833
He's gone to the petrol pump.
He'll be back soon.

01:42:26.125 --> 01:42:27.791
-Listen, are you eating enough--
-Okay, bye.

01:42:41.208 --> 01:42:42.125
Thank you, sir.

01:42:43.458 --> 01:42:44.416
Hello.

01:42:50.291 --> 01:42:51.875
So you didn't tell anyone?

01:42:52.625 --> 01:42:54.000
Only my youngest daughter knows.

01:42:54.333 --> 01:42:55.208
Why?

01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:57.708
I just decided not to.

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:01.750
Running away at this age?

01:43:03.916 --> 01:43:06.583
I've thought about running away
many times before.

01:43:08.125 --> 01:43:09.416
This time, I actually did it.

01:43:11.416 --> 01:43:12.541
You're quite something.

01:43:13.833 --> 01:43:15.083
He must be worried sick.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:20.875
His name is Sanjeev.

01:43:22.875 --> 01:43:24.166
Let him worry a bit.

01:43:26.250 --> 01:43:27.666
I gave him 40 years,

01:43:28.875 --> 01:43:31.000
can't he spare me 40 hours?

01:43:33.958 --> 01:43:36.125
You may have wrinkles now,
but you're still just as mischievous.

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.375
You should leave soon,
the airport's far from here.

01:43:44.708 --> 01:43:46.375
Are you really going
to let me go again?

01:43:49.291 --> 01:43:51.500
Don't worry, I'm leaving, I promise.

01:43:51.958 --> 01:43:53.166
What's the point of stopping you now?

01:43:54.208 --> 01:43:56.708
Neither our youth remains, nor that city.

01:43:59.125 --> 01:44:00.458
The city looks the same,

01:44:02.416 --> 01:44:04.041
but maybe we've changed.

01:44:05.833 --> 01:44:06.708
Maybe.

01:44:07.416 --> 01:44:09.291
Age is just a number, Parimal.

01:44:11.250 --> 01:44:14.875
If you forget to count for a day,
I'll forget my flight.

01:44:44.583 --> 01:44:48.166
I like the weather in your city

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:51.916
It's so fine

01:44:52.291 --> 01:44:56.083
Let me steal an evening

01:44:56.375 --> 01:45:00.083
If you don't mind

01:45:00.333 --> 01:45:04.458
If you can forget me

01:45:04.541 --> 01:45:07.791
Then go on, be free

01:45:08.166 --> 01:45:12.625
But to forget you

01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:15.708
Might take a lifetime for me

01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:19.708
Might take a lifetime

01:45:19.916 --> 01:45:23.750
For me

01:45:23.958 --> 01:45:27.583
To forget you

01:45:27.666 --> 01:45:31.708
Might take a lifetime for me

01:45:31.791 --> 01:45:35.458
Might take a lifetime

01:45:35.708 --> 01:45:39.541
For me

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:42.500
To forget you

01:45:43.625 --> 01:45:47.041
Might take a lifetime for me

01:45:47.125 --> 01:45:48.041
Where could Ma possibly go?

01:45:48.125 --> 01:45:49.750
But how do I contact her?

01:45:50.083 --> 01:45:51.541
Okay, I'm not supposed to tell you this,

01:45:51.625 --> 01:45:54.041
but she took my spare phone with her.

01:45:54.625 --> 01:45:55.833
So you can just call her there.

01:45:55.958 --> 01:45:57.416
I already tried that.

01:45:57.791 --> 01:45:59.416
She has blocked me.

01:46:00.041 --> 01:46:01.125
Who does that?

01:46:01.291 --> 01:46:04.916
Baba, I'm just saying
what you told Kajol.

01:46:06.041 --> 01:46:09.625
You have to fall in love
with the same person again and again.

01:46:10.916 --> 01:46:11.916
Give it a try.

01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:13.750
Go, find her.

01:46:13.958 --> 01:46:16.291
Track her friends, her college…

01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:17.833
locate her phone.

01:46:18.416 --> 01:46:21.625
Just woo her again, Baba.

01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:22.750
Okay.

01:46:22.958 --> 01:46:25.625
Or your second option is
to just give her space.

01:46:25.875 --> 01:46:26.791
What?

01:46:31.208 --> 01:46:37.916
I admit it this time
The fault was mine

01:46:39.166 --> 01:46:44.916
The one who once loved me

01:46:46.416 --> 01:46:50.166
Now draws a hard line

01:46:50.375 --> 01:46:54.791
Don't be so harsh
There's pain you can't see

01:46:54.958 --> 01:47:01.625
My heart keeps aching endlessly

01:47:02.291 --> 01:47:06.416
If you must betray me

01:47:06.583 --> 01:47:09.916
Do it so true

01:47:10.125 --> 01:47:14.333
If you must betray me

01:47:14.416 --> 01:47:17.791
Do it so true

01:47:18.041 --> 01:47:21.916
That no one else

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.583
Feels like a betrayal after you

01:47:25.833 --> 01:47:29.458
Might take a lifetime

01:47:29.666 --> 01:47:33.583
For me

01:47:33.791 --> 01:47:36.750
To forget you

01:47:37.666 --> 01:47:43.000
Might take a lifetime for me

01:47:48.208 --> 01:47:49.708
Bani, you used to forget your
lines back then, too.

01:47:49.791 --> 01:47:51.666
I miss that so much.

01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:54.625
That fluttery feeling right before
stepping on stage.

01:47:54.708 --> 01:47:55.625
Those jitters…

01:47:56.166 --> 01:47:57.500
Can't feel that anymore.

01:47:58.541 --> 01:47:59.458
Why not?

01:48:01.625 --> 01:48:02.833
You can, if you want to.

01:48:03.666 --> 01:48:04.583
Are you doing a play right now?

01:48:05.875 --> 01:48:08.958
Yeah, I am. But I can't do it alone.

01:48:10.166 --> 01:48:11.666
There's this brilliant part
in it for you.

01:48:13.208 --> 01:48:15.500
If you do it,
I swear it's Oscar-worthy.

01:48:15.958 --> 01:48:18.166
-An Oscar?
-Wow!

01:48:18.250 --> 01:48:20.083
Okay.

01:48:20.541 --> 01:48:21.500
So what's the part?

01:48:26.958 --> 01:48:27.958
Stop.

01:48:35.791 --> 01:48:37.250
Meet your new mom.

01:48:37.541 --> 01:48:39.500
Shibani Ghosh Sarkar.

01:48:39.791 --> 01:48:40.791
Hi.

01:48:48.458 --> 01:48:49.333
Nice.

01:48:50.833 --> 01:48:52.041
Where's our room?

01:48:59.583 --> 01:49:02.000
Oh, big, nice room.

01:49:02.291 --> 01:49:03.416
Hey, what's your name?

01:49:03.791 --> 01:49:05.125
Whatever, whose room is this anyway?

01:49:05.958 --> 01:49:08.250
-Mine.
-You're alone, and there are two of us.

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:10.500
Put my bag here.
We'll take this room.

01:49:10.666 --> 01:49:11.625
Go on.

01:49:17.041 --> 01:49:19.000
I'm feeling so bad.
She's such a sweet kid.

01:49:19.083 --> 01:49:20.750
Don't say that, please.

01:49:20.875 --> 01:49:21.958
Okay, okay.

01:49:23.375 --> 01:49:25.208
Pari, aren't you going to join me?

01:49:35.416 --> 01:49:36.708
How can you be so cruel?

01:49:37.166 --> 01:49:38.375
She was nearly in tears.

01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:40.500
That's the point.

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:44.708
I want her to cry, get mad, hate me…

01:49:45.833 --> 01:49:46.833
and then leave.

01:49:52.166 --> 01:49:54.666
-He didn't even know it was you?
-Nope.

01:49:54.750 --> 01:49:57.333
Then I stripped him almost naked,

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:00.458
took his clothes,

01:50:00.875 --> 01:50:03.500
-and left him in the hotel corridor.
-Wow.

01:50:03.791 --> 01:50:04.958
What's your story?

01:50:05.583 --> 01:50:07.916
Your girlfriend dumped you?
Ditched you?

01:50:08.375 --> 01:50:09.291
Bang on.

01:50:09.541 --> 01:50:10.666
What? Where?

01:50:11.791 --> 01:50:13.333
Where did she go? She went up.

01:50:14.375 --> 01:50:15.250
What?

01:50:16.333 --> 01:50:17.333
She's dead.

01:50:18.958 --> 01:50:19.916
That's a new one.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.875
You mean dead to you, right?

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.375
No, like dead, dead.

01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:26.416
Oh shit, I'm so sorry.

01:50:28.541 --> 01:50:29.750
What was her name?

01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:31.708
-Ria.
-What?

01:50:32.833 --> 01:50:35.166
{\an8}Ria!

01:50:35.541 --> 01:50:37.083
Ria!

01:50:37.208 --> 01:50:39.250
Life is shit!

01:50:39.458 --> 01:50:42.375
Shit!

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:45.958
All men are dogs!

01:50:46.041 --> 01:50:49.375
Dogs!

01:50:51.625 --> 01:50:54.083
The world's biggest idiot is…

01:50:54.166 --> 01:50:57.750
Monty Sisodia! Sisodia! Sisodia!

01:50:58.208 --> 01:50:59.458
Let's get out of here.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.041
Okay.

01:51:04.333 --> 01:51:05.875
Gemini, my phone is stolen.

01:51:06.250 --> 01:51:07.166
How to find it?

01:51:07.375 --> 01:51:08.750
To find your stolen phone,

01:51:08.958 --> 01:51:12.500
download the Find My Device app
and enter your details.

01:51:13.875 --> 01:51:16.791
No, Baba likes green tea in the morning.

01:51:16.958 --> 01:51:18.875
If he drinks milk tea,
he gets acidity.

01:51:18.958 --> 01:51:22.958
My, my, you say it like he's always lived

01:51:23.333 --> 01:51:24.791
with you and never with me.

01:51:25.625 --> 01:51:31.958
I've always given him strong,
milky tea with sugar.

01:51:32.125 --> 01:51:34.250
He never complained about acidity.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:35.875
Throw it away.

01:51:35.958 --> 01:51:37.958
-Slow down, please.
-Oh yes.

01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:40.125
Hey. What was your name?

01:51:40.666 --> 01:51:41.583
Doesn't matter.

01:51:41.791 --> 01:51:45.333
Tomorrow morning, be up early
and start working in the kitchen.

01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:47.541
I didn't come here to be a maid.

01:51:48.666 --> 01:51:49.916
Can I ask you something?

01:51:52.958 --> 01:51:54.583
How long have you two
known each other?

01:51:55.958 --> 01:51:57.416
About seven years now.

01:51:58.166 --> 01:51:59.625
One of his friends was a regular.

01:52:00.541 --> 01:52:01.875
Regular?

01:52:02.166 --> 01:52:04.041
My regular client.

01:52:04.625 --> 01:52:06.541
That's how I met Parimal.

01:52:07.125 --> 01:52:10.041
Since then,
he's been my only regular client.

01:52:10.833 --> 01:52:13.416
Others came once in a while.

01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:16.083
But he never missed a single day.

01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:20.875
Who else comes to people like
us for entertainment at this age?

01:52:26.708 --> 01:52:28.208
When his wife passed away…

01:52:28.958 --> 01:52:30.666
I did feel bad for him.

01:52:31.375 --> 01:52:32.708
But selfishly, I was happy too.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.791
I thought he'd come to meet me
daily instead of weekly.

01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:39.541
I even hoped he might marry me!

01:52:40.791 --> 01:52:43.750
But he made me wait five years.

01:52:44.625 --> 01:52:45.500
You know why?

01:52:45.708 --> 01:52:46.875
Because of you!

01:52:54.916 --> 01:52:57.541
I was going to call you.

01:52:57.833 --> 01:52:59.375
Ma, call Baba once.

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:00.958
He is really worried.

01:53:01.375 --> 01:53:03.000
Hi! Hi, Ma!

01:53:03.083 --> 01:53:04.166
-Hi, how's Goa?
-Hi.

01:53:04.291 --> 01:53:05.583
Oh, Goa's great.

01:53:05.833 --> 01:53:08.083
Why are you wearing rollers?

01:53:09.041 --> 01:53:10.458
Sis, your hair looks nice.

01:53:10.625 --> 01:53:11.500
Really?

01:53:11.583 --> 01:53:12.541
I don't know.

01:53:13.916 --> 01:53:15.125
You sorted things out
with your husband?

01:53:15.208 --> 01:53:17.833
-Well, it's…
-Hey, Maya, your helmet.

01:53:17.958 --> 01:53:19.458
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

01:53:20.166 --> 01:53:21.333
I'm coming.

01:53:21.708 --> 01:53:23.666
-Maya?
-I have been waiting for a long time.

01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:24.708
I'll tell you later.

01:53:24.791 --> 01:53:26.625
This is… this is Parimal.

01:53:26.708 --> 01:53:30.291
Parimal, that's Chumki
and that's my eldest, Kajol.

01:53:31.083 --> 01:53:32.583
-Hi.
-Hello.

01:53:32.666 --> 01:53:33.875
Bye.

01:53:34.083 --> 01:53:35.666
Listen, we need to leave.

01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:36.666
Okay.

01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:38.250
Okay, Ma, I have to go.

01:53:38.333 --> 01:53:39.791
Chumki, bye. Talk to you later.

01:53:39.875 --> 01:53:41.000
-Bye!
-Bye!

01:53:42.375 --> 01:53:43.416
Bye.

01:53:48.916 --> 01:53:51.125
Hey, what are you doing
over here by yourself?

01:53:54.750 --> 01:53:56.041
I've got my eyes on you.

01:53:57.083 --> 01:53:58.166
Stay off the phone.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.333
What a total creep!
Such a damn pervert.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.500
I swear, I just want to smack him.

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.250
You really should've
told people about us.

01:54:12.541 --> 01:54:14.333
Have you completely lost it, babe?

01:54:14.958 --> 01:54:16.875
If we tell him…

01:54:16.958 --> 01:54:18.958
maybe he'll stop touching me
all the time?

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.791
Come on, everyone knows
he has a thing for you.

01:54:22.208 --> 01:54:23.125
Correct?

01:54:23.541 --> 01:54:25.708
If he finds out we're engaged,

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.041
who do you think he's going
to take it out on?

01:54:28.666 --> 01:54:29.708
Me, that's who.

01:54:29.791 --> 01:54:31.333
Just three more months, babe.

01:54:31.583 --> 01:54:33.416
I'll get my promotion,
and he'll be gone.

01:54:40.708 --> 01:54:42.833
Theater's got a fix for everything.

01:54:43.333 --> 01:54:45.583
You've got to let that anger out.

01:54:46.208 --> 01:54:48.083
Come on,
let's get it out of your system.

01:54:48.250 --> 01:54:53.000
Alright, throw me the name
of a fruit or vegetable. Go on.

01:54:54.541 --> 01:54:57.000
-Okra? Carrot?
-No, not quite…

01:54:57.083 --> 01:54:58.208
-Papaya?
-Papaya!

01:54:58.416 --> 01:55:00.000
Okay, papaya, very good. Okay.

01:55:00.416 --> 01:55:02.375
Alright, now say "papaya"
like you're really pissed.

01:55:03.833 --> 01:55:04.875
Papaya!

01:55:05.375 --> 01:55:06.291
Come on, more rage.

01:55:10.125 --> 01:55:11.250
Papaya!

01:55:11.333 --> 01:55:12.250
You've got more in you.

01:55:14.708 --> 01:55:16.000
Papaya!

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.750
Mad at the whole damn world?
Let it rip.

01:55:19.083 --> 01:55:20.166
Say, "Papaya!"

01:55:21.166 --> 01:55:22.708
Papaya!

01:55:22.791 --> 01:55:24.333
Papaya!

01:55:24.625 --> 01:55:26.333
Papaya!

01:55:26.416 --> 01:55:30.000
-Papaya!
-Papaya!

01:55:55.083 --> 01:55:56.125
That really flipped a switch.

01:56:04.666 --> 01:56:05.791
You were right.

01:56:11.583 --> 01:56:12.875
Nothing's permanent.

01:56:16.791 --> 01:56:18.000
Everyone's just pretending.

01:56:19.833 --> 01:56:22.083
I've lost trust in every relationship.

01:56:24.875 --> 01:56:27.500
You know, in cognitive psychology,
there's a term for this, "HaSaAn".

01:56:28.208 --> 01:56:29.250
What does that mean?

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:32.708
It's when you feel happy, sad,
and angry all at once.

01:56:33.375 --> 01:56:34.250
"Ha-Sa-An."

01:56:37.291 --> 01:56:39.250
How do you invent all these words?

01:57:05.375 --> 01:57:12.041
The first time we meet again

01:57:14.333 --> 01:57:16.916
We'll smile and softly say

01:57:19.250 --> 01:57:22.208
What's your name?

01:57:22.958 --> 01:57:27.625
The first time you

01:57:28.333 --> 01:57:30.750
Knocked on my heart

01:57:32.916 --> 01:57:35.583
Called me out fast

01:57:37.625 --> 01:57:40.083
Told me stories fresh and true

01:57:40.458 --> 01:57:47.083
It cast a spell

01:57:47.458 --> 01:57:51.583
Did its magic too

01:57:52.125 --> 01:57:56.375
Then broke into a smile

01:57:56.791 --> 01:58:00.083
And stole my heart

01:58:00.375 --> 01:58:02.041
From now on,
I'll give him his meds. Leave.

01:58:02.208 --> 01:58:04.666
Why? Why can't you call her "Ma"?
Call her, "Ma."

01:58:04.916 --> 01:58:06.750
Don't raise your voice at me.
Keep your voice down, alright?

01:58:06.875 --> 01:58:10.625
Oh, this heart of mine

01:58:10.708 --> 01:58:13.041
Oh, this heart of mine

01:58:15.375 --> 01:58:19.333
Oh, this heart of mine

01:58:41.083 --> 01:58:42.125
What's wrong with you?

01:58:42.916 --> 01:58:47.833
Never touch a girl
without her permission!

01:59:01.625 --> 01:59:02.583
Chumki!

01:59:03.166 --> 01:59:05.291
-Chumki! Have you completely lost it?
-What?

01:59:05.916 --> 01:59:07.333
Look, I don't care if you have to resign.

01:59:07.583 --> 01:59:09.083
I'm not taking the fallout
for what you just did.

01:59:09.166 --> 01:59:10.166
You have to apologize.

01:59:10.708 --> 01:59:12.208
I already did what I had to.

01:59:13.208 --> 01:59:15.041
Maybe it was a bit late, but I did it.

01:59:15.458 --> 01:59:16.791
And now that I have,

01:59:17.458 --> 01:59:19.291
it's up to you to decide
what to do next.

01:59:23.166 --> 01:59:24.041
Take care.

01:59:24.375 --> 01:59:25.250
Chumki…

01:59:27.958 --> 01:59:29.375
Did you love Sudha?

01:59:30.916 --> 01:59:31.958
She was really nice.

01:59:33.541 --> 01:59:36.333
Very caring. A good mother and
a good wife.

01:59:38.375 --> 01:59:39.916
I think I loved her.

01:59:42.041 --> 01:59:43.625
Living together,
love became inevitable.

01:59:45.166 --> 01:59:48.125
Same story there. Ditto.

01:59:50.083 --> 01:59:51.500
I eventually fell in love with him.

01:59:58.666 --> 01:59:59.541
What?

02:00:01.208 --> 02:00:02.583
It's just weird, right?

02:00:02.875 --> 02:00:05.666
Us, here in this room,

02:00:06.583 --> 02:00:09.125
like this… It's so bizarre.

02:00:12.416 --> 02:00:13.333
Thank you.

02:00:13.875 --> 02:00:14.875
For what?

02:00:17.166 --> 02:00:19.791
For going along with this strange
little plan of mine.

02:00:21.875 --> 02:00:23.916
I'm just doing it for the Oscar.

02:00:26.458 --> 02:00:29.625
-Hello.
-Sir, I haven't received the cheque.

02:00:29.708 --> 02:00:32.041
-What cheque?
-I really needed that money.

02:00:32.166 --> 02:00:35.875
-I know I'm new, but money is tight…
-The cheque is not ready.

02:00:36.375 --> 02:00:37.791
Could you please…

02:00:37.875 --> 02:00:39.000
Yes. I will call you later.

02:00:51.125 --> 02:00:55.666
Perhaps somewhere on this land

02:00:55.916 --> 02:01:00.500
New flowers blossom
And meet the butterflies

02:01:00.625 --> 02:01:04.791
In such a way

02:01:05.083 --> 02:01:08.791
In such a way

02:01:09.958 --> 02:01:14.416
A lake descends from lonely mountains

02:01:14.583 --> 02:01:19.416
The innocent asks where the abode is

02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:23.250
Of yours

02:01:23.666 --> 02:01:27.208
Of yours

02:01:27.708 --> 02:01:32.041
It cast a spell

02:01:32.333 --> 02:01:36.375
Did its magic too

02:01:37.041 --> 02:01:39.750
Please, Jhinuk. I've got a friend
at the consulate.

02:01:39.833 --> 02:01:41.583
He can get you an emergency visa.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.208
Just say yes, okay?

02:01:43.291 --> 02:01:44.541
I'll speak to Uncle.

02:01:46.375 --> 02:01:50.583
It said

02:01:51.041 --> 02:01:54.750
It is no stranger

02:01:54.875 --> 02:01:56.000
Please think about it.

02:01:56.083 --> 02:02:00.041
Then broke into a smile

02:02:00.291 --> 02:02:04.250
My heart

02:02:04.333 --> 02:02:08.208
Oh, this heart of mine

02:02:08.541 --> 02:02:11.833
-Oh, this heart of mine
-Come on.

02:02:12.041 --> 02:02:16.625
Oh, this heart of mine

02:02:16.791 --> 02:02:21.375
Oh, this heart of mine

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:25.958
Oh, this heart of mine

02:02:26.125 --> 02:02:30.583
Oh, this heart of mine

02:02:30.875 --> 02:02:35.500
Oh, this heart of mine

02:02:35.625 --> 02:02:40.125
Oh, this heart of mine

02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:44.625
Oh, this heart of mine

02:02:44.791 --> 02:02:51.041
Oh, this heart of mine

02:03:02.833 --> 02:03:03.875
You will fall down.

02:03:03.958 --> 02:03:04.916
Hang on, just a second.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.583
Take it easy, okay?

02:03:06.666 --> 02:03:08.000
-You good?
-Okay? I'm okay.

02:03:08.083 --> 02:03:09.041
-Alright, let's go.
-Very good.

02:03:10.041 --> 02:03:10.958
Let me go.

02:03:11.125 --> 02:03:12.500
Please, stop it.

02:03:12.708 --> 02:03:14.125
Kajol, you're going to fall! The water…

02:03:14.250 --> 02:03:16.000
My name is Maya.

02:03:16.416 --> 02:03:19.958
I'm Maya, okay?
And no touching Maya.

02:03:20.041 --> 02:03:21.416
-Okay.
-No touching Maya.

02:03:21.541 --> 02:03:22.416
-Stop it.
-Okay, Maya.

02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:23.416
-No touching.
-You're drunk.

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:25.500
-You're drunk.
-Listen…

02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:28.041
-Yeah?
-I've had a couple of drinks, sure.

02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:29.125
So?

02:03:29.250 --> 02:03:30.291
-So what?
-You'll fall.

02:03:30.375 --> 02:03:32.166
So what? No, no, no.

02:03:32.458 --> 02:03:34.458
I might be high,

02:03:35.125 --> 02:03:36.875
-but I am totally in my senses.
-Okay.

02:03:36.958 --> 02:03:39.333
Okay? Leave me alone. Just
leave me completely alone.

02:03:39.916 --> 02:03:41.041
Stop it, stop it.

02:03:41.541 --> 02:03:42.958
How dare you behave like
this with women?

02:03:43.083 --> 02:03:45.541
Who's here? Who else is here?

02:03:45.708 --> 02:03:49.083
Excuse me, just see this man is…

02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:51.000
he is harassing me.

02:03:51.083 --> 02:03:52.166
-Hey.
-Just stop it.

02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:53.125
No…

02:03:53.208 --> 02:03:54.125
Stop it.

02:03:54.208 --> 02:03:56.041
You should learn to respect women.

02:03:56.166 --> 02:03:57.041
Bye-bye.

02:03:57.125 --> 02:03:58.708
-I've got a black belt.
-Just go.

02:03:58.791 --> 02:04:00.208
-What are you going to do now?
-Bye.

02:04:00.291 --> 02:04:01.583
I am her husband.

02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:03.166
Take him. Come on, let's go.

02:04:03.250 --> 02:04:04.250
You…

02:04:10.458 --> 02:04:12.041
I sent the ticket on WhatsApp.

02:04:12.916 --> 02:04:14.250
The wedding procession leaves
the day after tomorrow.

02:04:14.458 --> 02:04:15.750
The train departs at 5:30.

02:04:16.791 --> 02:04:19.125
We've got two full bogies
booked from Kalka.

02:04:19.833 --> 02:04:21.583
We'll laugh and chat on the way.
It's going to be--

02:04:21.666 --> 02:04:22.833
Actually, I'm going back to Pune.

02:04:24.958 --> 02:04:26.125
You're not coming to my wedding?

02:04:26.458 --> 02:04:27.333
Sorry.

02:04:33.416 --> 02:04:34.416
Tell me something…

02:04:35.708 --> 02:04:38.291
why did you say
I didn't stand a chance?

02:04:38.958 --> 02:04:40.333
No chance at all.

02:04:41.083 --> 02:04:42.916
Because you didn't.

02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:44.416
Give me just one reason.

02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:47.125
One? I've got four.

02:04:47.666 --> 02:04:48.583
Okay.

02:04:49.583 --> 02:04:51.333
No steady income.

02:04:51.791 --> 02:04:53.458
No fixed job.

02:04:53.916 --> 02:04:56.666
No clarity about the future.

02:04:56.958 --> 02:04:58.125
-That's it?
-No,

02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:00.083
-the last one's the biggest.
-What's that?

02:05:00.333 --> 02:05:01.541
You're a total womanizer.

02:05:03.125 --> 02:05:04.458
That is history, bro.

02:05:05.291 --> 02:05:06.958
This is the new Parth 2.0.

02:05:07.583 --> 02:05:10.041
One woman man, whose sole purpose is…

02:05:10.458 --> 02:05:12.583
getting married,
settling down, and being stable.

02:05:15.291 --> 02:05:16.750
You're starting to sound like me.

02:05:17.958 --> 02:05:19.625
Yeah, shit.

02:05:19.791 --> 02:05:20.666
That's true.

02:05:21.666 --> 02:05:24.666
We've both taken a complete U-turn.

02:05:25.875 --> 02:05:28.458
If I ever feel like having
an extramarital affair,

02:05:29.166 --> 02:05:30.291
-you're the one I'm calling.
-Deal.

02:05:30.375 --> 02:05:31.416
-Promise.
-For sure.

02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:32.416
Shake on it.

02:05:33.583 --> 02:05:34.958
-Will you even pick up my call?
-Shut up.

02:05:37.875 --> 02:05:39.416
Come on,
let's get drunk and have some fun.

02:05:39.916 --> 02:05:40.916
Let's do it.

02:05:46.208 --> 02:05:50.750
Whether you sense it or you don't

02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:56.375
Whether you accept it or not

02:05:56.750 --> 02:06:01.958
I can't survive if you're not near

02:06:02.041 --> 02:06:08.166
But that's the truth I hide in fear

02:06:08.250 --> 02:06:12.666
How much more love can I give you?

02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:18.500
I've already given you all the love I have

02:06:18.583 --> 02:06:23.000
How much more love can I give you?

02:06:23.125 --> 02:06:28.416
I've already given you all the love I have

02:06:50.416 --> 02:06:52.416
Are you sure about this abortion?

02:06:53.833 --> 02:06:54.708
Yes.

02:06:55.375 --> 02:06:56.833
What does Akash have to say?

02:06:58.541 --> 02:07:00.375
He doesn't even know I'm pregnant.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:01.875
What?

02:07:01.958 --> 02:07:03.500
Aren't you going to tell him
before aborting?

02:07:05.541 --> 02:07:08.125
I'll tell him when the time's right.

02:07:09.416 --> 02:07:10.416
Not now.

02:07:14.833 --> 02:07:19.625
I breathe because you breathe

02:07:20.125 --> 02:07:24.916
I live because you live

02:07:25.416 --> 02:07:31.416
I get somewhat scared
When you're not around

02:07:31.541 --> 02:07:36.833
Even living, I somewhat die

02:07:36.916 --> 02:07:41.208
How much more love can I give you?

02:07:41.375 --> 02:07:47.125
I've already given you all the love I have

02:07:47.250 --> 02:07:51.708
I bow at your shrine

02:07:51.791 --> 02:07:57.000
I've already given you all the love I have

02:08:32.958 --> 02:08:34.083
Help! Someone help!

02:08:34.916 --> 02:08:37.708
Parimal! Parimal!
What's happening to you?

02:08:38.708 --> 02:08:39.666
-Baba!
-Are you okay?

02:08:39.916 --> 02:08:40.833
Come on, try to get up.
Careful.

02:08:40.958 --> 02:08:43.208
Since you came, he's been doing
things he's not supposed to.

02:08:43.291 --> 02:08:45.291
-Sit down.
-You give him alcohol and milk tea.

02:08:45.416 --> 02:08:46.708
-Did you feel lightheaded?
-He's already had a heart attack.

02:08:46.791 --> 02:08:48.541
-Are you feeling better now?
-Do you even know that?

02:08:48.708 --> 02:08:49.958
I don't know what you want.

02:08:50.041 --> 02:08:52.333
Forget what I want,
it's pretty clear what you want.

02:08:52.958 --> 02:08:54.708
She doesn't want us to be happy.

02:08:54.875 --> 02:08:55.916
She just pretends to care.

02:08:56.083 --> 02:08:57.125
You were right.

02:08:57.375 --> 02:08:59.000
She's cursed.

02:08:59.416 --> 02:09:01.708
If she weren't here,
the accident wouldn't have happened.

02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:04.500
-Are you okay now?
-Baba, why don't you say something to her?

02:09:04.583 --> 02:09:06.916
Tell her what you told me.

02:09:07.541 --> 02:09:10.375
Say she's after this house.

02:09:10.625 --> 02:09:12.125
Give her everything.

02:09:12.291 --> 02:09:14.041
Your flat, your bank balance, everything.

02:09:14.125 --> 02:09:15.166
Do it today!

02:09:15.291 --> 02:09:16.666
We'll stay somewhere else.

02:09:18.541 --> 02:09:20.791
I want Baba to say it.

02:09:26.708 --> 02:09:27.833
You want me to say it?

02:09:28.166 --> 02:09:29.125
Alright then.

02:09:29.208 --> 02:09:32.083
Call the lawyer.
Get the documents ready.

02:09:32.291 --> 02:09:34.250
I'll sign.

02:09:34.458 --> 02:09:35.750
-I'll transfer everything to you.
-Baba.

02:09:35.916 --> 02:09:37.416
You should've just told me
that's what you wanted.

02:09:37.791 --> 02:09:39.166
Now go and let us live in peace.

02:09:40.166 --> 02:09:41.083
Go.

02:10:01.375 --> 02:10:03.625
Was there no other way to do this?

02:10:06.375 --> 02:10:08.708
You're hurting.
And you're also hurting her.

02:10:10.708 --> 02:10:11.750
Don't do this.

02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:18.916
Some relationships
don't break on their own.

02:10:19.708 --> 02:10:22.416
You have to break
them yourself, with force.

02:10:37.458 --> 02:10:38.500
You're leaving today?

02:11:05.791 --> 02:11:06.875
I'll take my leave now, Baba.

02:11:11.958 --> 02:11:17.833
That understanding we once
Had between us

02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:24.000
Whether you remember or not

02:11:24.416 --> 02:11:30.041
That promise to stay true
Without complaint

02:11:30.791 --> 02:11:36.375
Whether you remember or not

02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:42.666
I recall it all in bits and parts

02:11:43.083 --> 02:11:48.416
Whether you remember or not

02:11:49.583 --> 02:11:52.125
Mornings, afternoons
Nights that turn to dawn

02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:55.250
We spent every stage of life intertwined

02:11:55.666 --> 02:11:58.250
Each moment is etched within my heart

02:11:58.458 --> 02:12:01.458
Whether you remember

02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:04.458
No grudges or complaints

02:12:04.958 --> 02:12:07.625
We met like sun meets morning rain

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.666
I have not forgotten a single feeling

02:12:10.791 --> 02:12:13.458
Whether you remember

02:12:13.833 --> 02:12:19.541
Whether you remember or not

02:12:19.791 --> 02:12:26.416
Whether you remember or not

02:12:44.625 --> 02:12:47.666
How can you just let anyone
into my room? It's not safe.

02:12:47.791 --> 02:12:50.291
You have no idea
who's coming in and out of here!

02:12:50.375 --> 02:12:52.125
-Look, he's still standing there!
-Sorry, ma'am.

02:12:52.208 --> 02:12:54.291
-Don't you care about women's safety here?
-Go, catch him!

02:12:54.375 --> 02:12:56.333
I'm calling the police.
I'll have this whole place shut down!

02:12:56.416 --> 02:12:57.291
Sorry, ma'am.

02:12:57.375 --> 02:12:59.791
-Go after him!
-I have not forgotten a single feeling

02:13:00.041 --> 02:13:03.375
Whether you remember

02:13:03.458 --> 02:13:06.166
No grudges or complaints

02:13:06.458 --> 02:13:09.083
We met like sun meets morning rain

02:13:09.583 --> 02:13:12.166
I have not forgotten a single feeling

02:13:12.333 --> 02:13:15.166
Whether you remember

02:13:15.375 --> 02:13:20.583
Whether you remember or not

02:13:20.666 --> 02:13:22.958
When's Arijit coming back from the US?

02:13:23.083 --> 02:13:24.708
When's he going to respond?

02:13:24.791 --> 02:13:26.208
When will we record it?

02:13:26.291 --> 02:13:27.375
-When will we shoot?
-I…

02:13:27.458 --> 02:13:28.958
I told you to keep a backup ready.

02:13:29.041 --> 02:13:30.916
We can't do much, sir.
Everyone wants Arijit.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.541
I need a song, sir.

02:13:32.625 --> 02:13:34.000
I need to shoot.

02:13:34.083 --> 02:13:36.041
I want the song tomorrow,
no matter what.

02:13:36.166 --> 02:13:37.416
-Alright.
-If he's not available,

02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:39.625
find someone else and call them.

02:13:39.833 --> 02:13:41.041
I want my song.

02:13:41.166 --> 02:13:42.500
-Hello, sir.
-Oh, hi.

02:13:43.166 --> 02:13:44.125
How's it going?

02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:45.666
Still sticking with it.

02:13:46.666 --> 02:13:47.833
Why don't you make him sing?

02:13:48.916 --> 02:13:50.875
-Try him.
-Sir, he's just an arranger.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.166
No, I know
he's got a playback singer's voice.

02:13:53.333 --> 02:13:55.333
I've heard his stuff.
He messaged me on WhatsApp.

02:13:55.916 --> 02:13:56.833
Are you sure?

02:13:56.916 --> 02:13:57.958
I'm very sure.

02:13:58.083 --> 02:13:59.208
Please, try him out.

02:13:59.291 --> 02:14:00.166
Yes, sir.

02:14:00.250 --> 02:14:01.125
Let's do this.
Somu…

02:14:01.208 --> 02:14:02.208
All the best.

02:14:24.208 --> 02:14:25.500
Shruti Shukla!

02:14:37.166 --> 02:14:38.166
Hello, Baba?

02:14:38.833 --> 02:14:39.708
Ma…

02:14:43.791 --> 02:14:44.833
Your Ma…

02:14:45.916 --> 02:14:47.375
Baba, are you crying?

02:14:48.833 --> 02:14:49.833
Got married…

02:14:50.625 --> 02:14:52.291
Who got married?
Baba, hello?

02:14:53.916 --> 02:14:56.000
-Again…
-Baba, I'm calling Ma.

02:14:56.083 --> 02:14:57.541
Just relax. I'll be there by tomorrow.

02:14:59.541 --> 02:15:00.458
Hello?

02:15:07.541 --> 02:15:09.958
-Hi, Ma!
-Hold, hold, hold, Chumki.

02:15:11.625 --> 02:15:12.958
Ma, it's quite noisy there.

02:15:14.041 --> 02:15:15.500
My college's reunion…

02:15:15.833 --> 02:15:17.333
Hang on,
I'll introduce you to everyone.

02:15:20.291 --> 02:15:22.041
I'll bring sis on the call too.

02:15:22.125 --> 02:15:24.000
-Hello, everyone. Chumki.
-Hi.

02:15:24.083 --> 02:15:25.208
Thank you.

02:15:25.375 --> 02:15:26.458
No worries.

02:15:28.666 --> 02:15:29.916
Oh, I have to take this.

02:15:30.250 --> 02:15:31.875
-Hello, dear.
-Hello, auntie.

02:15:32.833 --> 02:15:33.833
-Hello!
-How are you?

02:15:35.458 --> 02:15:36.666
I quit my job.

02:15:38.791 --> 02:15:39.833
I'm sorry.

02:15:42.083 --> 02:15:42.958
I know

02:15:43.041 --> 02:15:44.041
-I should've done it a long time ago.
-Hi, Ma.

02:15:44.125 --> 02:15:45.041
Hi, Chumki.

02:15:47.166 --> 02:15:48.208
Hi, sis.

02:15:48.625 --> 02:15:49.500
Chumki…

02:15:51.416 --> 02:15:52.375
How are you?

02:15:52.541 --> 02:15:54.916
When are you both coming back?
I'll be back in a minute.

02:15:55.125 --> 02:15:56.500
I'll be back tomorrow.

02:15:56.583 --> 02:15:58.000
I'm coming back tomorrow too.

02:15:58.166 --> 02:15:59.041
Okay.

02:15:59.125 --> 02:16:01.291
Wow, Ma, it's so nice
to see you like this.

02:16:01.416 --> 02:16:03.333
Right?
Even I'm surprised at myself.

02:16:03.541 --> 02:16:05.750
I didn't even realize how fast
these last four days flew by.

02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:08.208
Madness, friends…

02:16:09.125 --> 02:16:13.375
And I keep thinking how amazing it would
be if life could just go on like this.

02:16:15.708 --> 02:16:16.750
But you know,

02:16:16.833 --> 02:16:19.083
we spend half our lives stuck
in confusion,

02:16:19.166 --> 02:16:20.708
not really knowing what we want.

02:16:21.583 --> 02:16:23.375
We don't make the right decision
at the right time.

02:16:23.833 --> 02:16:25.458
And in hoping for something better,

02:16:27.208 --> 02:16:28.791
we end up choosing what's safer.

02:16:29.625 --> 02:16:33.583
Then we spend the rest of our lives
swinging between "I wish" and "what if."

02:16:34.583 --> 02:16:36.708
Deep down, your heart always
knows what it wants.

02:16:37.541 --> 02:16:38.583
It sends you signals, too.

02:16:40.166 --> 02:16:41.458
We just forget to listen.

02:16:43.416 --> 02:16:45.125
I'll tell you
all the stories when we meet.

02:16:45.791 --> 02:16:47.958
But it was bizarre.

02:16:48.541 --> 02:16:50.500
So much drama, I tell you…

02:16:50.916 --> 02:16:52.666
But honestly,
that drama brought me

02:16:53.625 --> 02:16:56.416
back to myself, the old Bani.

02:16:57.125 --> 02:16:58.333
She now understands
that instead of regretting

02:16:58.583 --> 02:17:00.083
-the chances you never took…
-Glasses.

02:17:00.166 --> 02:17:02.916
It's better to take the risk
and deal with the fallout later.

02:17:04.458 --> 02:17:06.500
I had the time of my life!

02:17:06.583 --> 02:17:07.458
Really!

02:17:08.958 --> 02:17:10.000
Shibani!

02:17:10.416 --> 02:17:11.375
Coming!

02:17:11.583 --> 02:17:14.125
I'll see you at dinner tomorrow
and tell you everything.

02:17:14.208 --> 02:17:15.083
Okay, bye, Ma.

02:17:15.166 --> 02:17:16.291
-Bye.
-Bye, Ma.

02:17:22.458 --> 02:17:25.083
-You forgot your glasses.
-Oh shit!

02:17:25.500 --> 02:17:27.750
-Thank you.
-It's okay. No worries.

02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:30.458
Goodnight, Maya.

02:17:31.625 --> 02:17:32.708
Actually…

02:17:33.083 --> 02:17:35.416
Actually, my name isn't Maya.

02:17:37.541 --> 02:17:38.833
My name's Kajol.

02:17:39.916 --> 02:17:40.958
Okay.

02:17:41.083 --> 02:17:42.125
Kajol Ghosh.

02:17:42.750 --> 02:17:43.708
Sorry.

02:17:50.333 --> 02:17:51.375
One sec, one sec.

02:17:51.458 --> 02:17:53.541
This song might sound romantic,

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.041
but it's not your typical hero-heroine
kind of romantic.

02:17:56.458 --> 02:17:58.583
Our protagonist had a baby.

02:17:58.666 --> 02:18:00.041
He's singing it for his child.

02:18:00.375 --> 02:18:03.041
So picture that it's your baby
and sing from that place.

02:18:03.791 --> 02:18:05.375
I don't have a baby.

02:18:05.791 --> 02:18:07.166
But you've got an imagination, right?

02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:18.083
Look

02:18:18.458 --> 02:18:23.208
How your arrival changed my life

02:18:23.708 --> 02:18:27.000
A closed room lit up

02:18:27.541 --> 02:18:32.000
And a window opened wide

02:18:32.291 --> 02:18:35.625
Look

02:18:35.791 --> 02:18:40.333
How your arrival changed my life

02:18:40.791 --> 02:18:44.416
A closed room lit up

02:18:44.625 --> 02:18:50.125
And a window opened wide

02:18:52.666 --> 02:18:56.750
Your tiny hands gripping my finger tight

02:18:56.833 --> 02:19:01.458
Since I saw you, the world feels right

02:19:01.583 --> 02:19:05.916
You waking softly in the night

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:11.625
You speaking to me without a word in sight

02:19:14.166 --> 02:19:18.333
You sleeping as the morning breaks

02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:22.416
Your breath is all my being needs

02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:27.000
My shoulder is now your resting place

02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:33.958
Your babbling sounds like music to me

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:35.958
Papa.

02:19:48.916 --> 02:19:49.791
Cut.

02:19:52.208 --> 02:19:53.500
I am sorry.
Cut.

02:19:54.958 --> 02:19:55.875
Is he alright?

02:20:04.041 --> 02:20:06.625
There's a lot we never said
to each other, right?

02:20:07.166 --> 02:20:09.666
I felt there was
something real between us.

02:20:10.208 --> 02:20:11.166
We connected. Right?

02:20:11.375 --> 02:20:13.041
Everything remained incomplete--

02:20:33.708 --> 02:20:35.416
-Chumki…
-My bag, please.

02:20:37.541 --> 02:20:40.083
-Chumki…
-I'm leaving. Lock the door when you go.

02:20:44.833 --> 02:20:47.625
-I'm going to kill you!
-Sanjeev!

02:20:56.375 --> 02:20:57.291
Rickshaw!

02:20:59.958 --> 02:21:00.916
Rickshaw!

02:21:01.083 --> 02:21:03.375
Let him go! Let him go!

02:21:03.458 --> 02:21:04.750
What are you doing?

02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:17.541
What friend? What did you do?

02:21:17.625 --> 02:21:19.750
Your husband just hit me!

02:21:19.833 --> 02:21:21.583
-Please!
-Sanjeev!

02:21:23.333 --> 02:21:24.750
Rickshaw!

02:21:26.458 --> 02:21:27.875
Stop. Stop.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:32.958
Airport.

02:21:38.541 --> 02:21:39.958
I can't!

02:21:40.416 --> 02:21:41.500
Sorry.

02:21:41.708 --> 02:21:42.750
What's going on?

02:21:42.833 --> 02:21:44.166
Why do I still love him so much?

02:21:46.416 --> 02:21:47.333
Who are you talking about?

02:22:55.250 --> 02:22:56.166
Careful.

02:22:57.791 --> 02:22:58.708
Ambala.

02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:00.416
Shimla.

02:23:09.416 --> 02:23:10.416
Kajol!

02:23:12.375 --> 02:23:14.916
Hello! Wait! Stop!

02:23:25.291 --> 02:23:26.208
Hello!

02:23:27.416 --> 02:23:28.583
Say something!

02:23:32.625 --> 02:23:35.708
I don't know if I like boys or girls.

02:23:37.833 --> 02:23:38.916
When will you know?

02:23:39.916 --> 02:23:40.875
I don't know.

02:23:42.041 --> 02:23:44.208
{\an8}Okay. I'll wait till you figure it out.

02:24:18.208 --> 02:24:19.083
Chumki!

02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:20.458
Chumki!

02:24:22.583 --> 02:24:23.500
Hi.

02:24:23.916 --> 02:24:25.125
I knew you'd show up.

02:24:25.833 --> 02:24:27.541
Did you come straight from bed?

02:24:27.625 --> 02:24:28.625
Where's your luggage?

02:24:29.375 --> 02:24:31.250
Get off at the next station
and come here.

02:24:31.333 --> 02:24:33.375
Parth, I need to talk to you.

02:24:33.958 --> 02:24:34.916
Yeah, what's up?

02:24:35.125 --> 02:24:36.375
I really like…

02:24:37.291 --> 02:24:38.208
your company.

02:24:38.291 --> 02:24:39.833
I really like your company.

02:24:40.541 --> 02:24:42.166
Me too. Ditto.

02:24:42.916 --> 02:24:45.000
I know we haven't spent
much time together,

02:24:45.083 --> 02:24:48.666
but it feels very real.

02:24:49.333 --> 02:24:51.041
It feels different with you. I…

02:24:52.041 --> 02:24:54.041
I like myself more when I'm with you.

02:24:55.041 --> 02:24:56.958
I… Okay.

02:24:57.500 --> 02:24:58.458
And honestly, I'm very jealous

02:24:58.541 --> 02:24:59.416
because you're getting
married to someone else.

02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:00.375
What?

02:25:02.416 --> 02:25:07.000
I'm very jealous because you're
getting married to someone else.

02:25:09.083 --> 02:25:10.833
You haven't come here to
"I love you", right?

02:25:23.166 --> 02:25:24.083
Hi.

02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:25.291
You didn't sleep?

02:25:25.375 --> 02:25:26.958
Yeah, no.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.250
You're done with the recording?

02:25:30.291 --> 02:25:31.208
How did it go?

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.208
It was fine.

02:25:35.041 --> 02:25:40.125
Hey, I can't connect to the Wi-Fi
on my laptop.

02:25:42.083 --> 02:25:44.416
Restart both the laptop and the router.

02:25:46.458 --> 02:25:47.333
I'll hold.

02:25:47.916 --> 02:25:48.833
Give me a minute.

02:25:49.625 --> 02:25:50.541
It's turning on.

02:25:53.541 --> 02:25:54.791
Alright, done.

02:25:56.625 --> 02:26:01.791
Now go to settings and hit
"Forget Network."

02:26:02.833 --> 02:26:04.125
Then try connecting again.

02:26:05.041 --> 02:26:06.083
Forget network…

02:26:07.291 --> 02:26:08.250
Connect…

02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:10.625
It's working.

02:26:14.125 --> 02:26:15.083
Even without the laptop?

02:26:32.250 --> 02:26:33.166
Parth!

02:26:36.041 --> 02:26:37.083
Parth!

02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:41.125
I love…

02:26:41.250 --> 02:26:42.333
I love you!

02:26:47.833 --> 02:26:50.250
What! What's the guarantee you won't fall
for a third girl tomorrow?

02:26:50.416 --> 02:26:51.625
No, I guarantee that.

02:26:52.666 --> 02:26:53.625
She's it, full and final.

02:26:53.708 --> 02:26:54.875
This isn't a joke, son.

02:26:55.375 --> 02:26:56.875
You're breaking off one engagement
to marry her.

02:26:56.958 --> 02:26:59.000
-What if tomorrow you want to marry--
-I'm not marrying him.

02:26:59.083 --> 02:26:59.958
What?

02:27:00.041 --> 02:27:01.333
-You're not marrying him?
-What?

02:27:01.583 --> 02:27:02.458
Then?

02:27:03.250 --> 02:27:04.791
I'm not marrying you.

02:27:05.666 --> 02:27:07.291
You don't want to marry me,

02:27:07.458 --> 02:27:09.291
but you also don't want me
to marry someone else?

02:27:10.250 --> 02:27:11.166
Yes.

02:27:11.791 --> 02:27:12.666
-Yes?
-Yes.

02:27:12.750 --> 02:27:13.750
What does that even mean?
What?

02:27:16.666 --> 02:27:18.583
It means I love you.

02:27:18.791 --> 02:27:20.375
Maybe I'm not ready right now.

02:27:22.041 --> 02:27:25.000
But someday in the future… maybe?

02:27:25.458 --> 02:27:26.333
Maybe?

02:27:26.833 --> 02:27:29.375
My grandfather came all the way
from Madagascar.

02:27:30.083 --> 02:27:32.333
He's 82. He might not be here
"someday".

02:27:32.416 --> 02:27:34.000
Auntie Neetu changed
three flights to be here.

02:27:35.791 --> 02:27:37.750
And I've already booked
the honeymoon in Bali.

02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:42.000
It's a nonrefundable thing, man.

02:27:44.708 --> 02:27:45.666
Sorry.

02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:49.375
Forget I was here. I'm so sorry.

02:27:49.458 --> 02:27:51.083
Okay? Cancel.

02:27:51.166 --> 02:27:52.083
I'm sorry.

02:27:52.166 --> 02:27:53.208
Forget it.

02:27:53.333 --> 02:27:54.666
Control. Alt. Delete. Sorry.

02:27:54.750 --> 02:27:55.833
Dear…

02:27:56.083 --> 02:27:58.291
-I'm fine.
-Dear!

02:28:18.583 --> 02:28:20.416
You shouldn't have had the abortion.

02:28:21.083 --> 02:28:22.208
No…

02:28:22.666 --> 02:28:24.666
I'm sorry.

02:28:31.708 --> 02:28:32.708
I'm sorry.

02:28:33.291 --> 02:28:36.708
I'm selfish. I'm very selfish.

02:28:37.125 --> 02:28:39.000
Forgive me.

02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:46.333
I am sorry.

02:28:46.458 --> 02:28:47.500
Akash.

02:28:55.625 --> 02:28:56.541
I…

02:28:56.625 --> 02:28:58.958
I am always late.

02:29:00.333 --> 02:29:01.541
I just want you.

02:29:02.583 --> 02:29:04.083
I don't want anything else.

02:29:05.958 --> 02:29:07.583
I just want you.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.583
It's too freaking late!

02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:16.916
You shouldn't have had the abortion.

02:29:17.666 --> 02:29:19.625
-I freaking know it's too late now!
-No, it's not too late.

02:29:21.625 --> 02:29:22.583
No.

02:29:58.666 --> 02:29:59.708
So, now?

02:30:02.416 --> 02:30:03.375
Now?

02:30:07.083 --> 02:30:08.291
Let's just get fake married.

02:30:09.375 --> 02:30:11.333
Otherwise, they'll disown me.

02:30:12.375 --> 02:30:13.500
Then promise me something first.

02:30:13.833 --> 02:30:14.791
What?

02:30:15.166 --> 02:30:16.958
From this moment on,

02:30:17.250 --> 02:30:18.625
no one else gets to see you naked.

02:30:19.916 --> 02:30:21.041
Done.

02:30:21.750 --> 02:30:22.750
But for that to work,
you'll have to see me naked first.

02:30:27.166 --> 02:30:30.500
-Your mom?
-Yes, Mom.

02:30:32.791 --> 02:30:34.666
-Hi.
-Hey.

02:30:35.625 --> 02:30:37.541
-The one you lost
-What's up?

02:30:37.875 --> 02:30:39.250
Yesterday

02:30:40.083 --> 02:30:41.500
How are you, buddy?

02:30:42.250 --> 02:30:43.250
Still angry with me?

02:30:43.333 --> 02:30:44.375
Hi.

02:30:44.791 --> 02:30:46.708
The one who was upset smiled

02:30:46.958 --> 02:30:48.041
Hi.

02:30:48.125 --> 02:30:49.541
-Hi, baby.
-Hi, Mumma.

02:30:49.833 --> 02:30:50.958
Papa's not here?

02:30:51.083 --> 02:30:53.000
No, he's not. He'll join us later.

02:30:53.083 --> 02:30:54.041
Come, sit.

02:30:54.125 --> 02:30:57.041
How can we ever part?

02:30:57.750 --> 02:31:01.708
We are, after all, one

02:31:02.625 --> 02:31:06.958
Love is like salt and sugar
Both add flavor, but in their own way

02:31:07.083 --> 02:31:13.666
This distance has been erased on its own

02:31:14.750 --> 02:31:19.166
It's a wonderful journey

02:31:20.041 --> 02:31:24.666
The wheel of life keeps moving

02:31:24.791 --> 02:31:31.666
Instead of halting
It's better to keep moving

02:31:32.416 --> 02:31:36.833
It's a wonderful journey

02:31:36.958 --> 02:31:40.125
We're out of chicken, please refill this.

02:31:41.958 --> 02:31:43.083
Is it going to go on like this?

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.083
No response?

02:31:45.166 --> 02:31:46.500
What do you want? A divorce?

02:31:48.875 --> 02:31:50.875
How else can I tell you that I am sorry?

02:31:51.541 --> 02:31:52.833
How many more times should I say sorry?

02:31:54.291 --> 02:31:57.333
Can't we start again from the beginning?

02:31:58.875 --> 02:32:02.458
You don't want to know
what happened in that room in Goa?

02:32:03.958 --> 02:32:08.416
No, I don't.
I don't want to know anything.

02:32:08.958 --> 02:32:11.166
All I know is that I was about
to lose you.

02:32:11.833 --> 02:32:16.000
Forget Goa, I don't care about anything
that happened before this very second.

02:32:16.583 --> 02:32:19.291
Stay angry, stay as mad as you want,

02:32:19.958 --> 02:32:21.166
but please let me keep trying
to win you over.

02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:24.958
All this…

02:32:26.083 --> 02:32:29.583
yoga, meditation, mindfulness,
none of it works

02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:33.125
Look, like a joker

02:32:33.541 --> 02:32:35.333
I followed you around for so many days.

02:32:35.833 --> 02:32:37.541
And I want to keep following you around.

02:32:38.416 --> 02:32:39.416
For the rest of my life.

02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:45.583
I want to charm you again.

02:32:47.250 --> 02:32:49.250
Again, and again.

02:32:49.916 --> 02:32:50.916
Forever.

02:32:52.083 --> 02:32:53.875
Only with you, every time.

02:32:58.916 --> 02:33:01.750
Your love for doing it in the open air
will get us caught one day.

02:33:47.333 --> 02:33:48.458
Bye…

02:33:49.041 --> 02:33:50.250
See you.

02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:51.583
Bye.

02:33:56.583 --> 02:33:57.666
Which way do I turn?

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.250
Yeah, I'm just checking--

02:34:00.333 --> 02:34:02.583
-Shit, it was that right we just passed.
-Which one?

02:34:02.791 --> 02:34:04.166
Oh no, one minute

02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:07.333
If you hold your phone like that,
then this is bound to happen…

02:34:07.416 --> 02:34:10.375
How is it my fault if the map
keeps changing the route?

02:34:10.666 --> 02:34:13.416
Now I have to take the long U-turn.

02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:16.500
-No…
-Besides, this still hasn't been fixed.

02:34:22.541 --> 02:34:24.083
We were supposed to fix this.

02:34:24.750 --> 02:34:25.708
We'll fix it.

02:34:26.041 --> 02:34:30.125
After losing you
And then finding you again

02:34:31.083 --> 02:34:35.333
I've developed a habit of it

02:34:35.875 --> 02:34:40.125
Feels like now

02:34:40.916 --> 02:34:45.250
True love is mine to claim…

02:34:45.416 --> 02:34:46.833
How did this happen?

02:34:47.166 --> 02:34:49.333
How will I know? You tell me.

02:34:49.416 --> 02:34:51.458
But these aren't
"two full dark pink lines," right?

02:34:51.583 --> 02:34:52.875
Yes, they are!

02:34:52.958 --> 02:34:55.458
The voice I heard

02:34:55.791 --> 02:35:00.666
Feels like now

02:35:00.916 --> 02:35:05.458
True love is mine to claim

02:35:06.208 --> 02:35:07.916
Shruti, listen carefully.
I'm playing two temp tracks.

02:35:08.125 --> 02:35:10.208
First, stop this guy's singing!

02:35:10.291 --> 02:35:11.833
The producer is coming in half an hour.

02:35:11.958 --> 02:35:13.583
I have to present them soon,
so please listen.

02:35:14.458 --> 02:35:17.208
I can't hear anything right now!
Can't you see he's crying?

02:35:17.666 --> 02:35:19.250
Please, sweetheart.

02:35:19.583 --> 02:35:21.375
Stop! I have a child with me!

02:35:21.916 --> 02:35:24.541
Look, I can't talk right now.
I have too much to do.

02:35:24.625 --> 02:35:25.625
-I have to go.
-You know…

02:35:25.708 --> 02:35:28.041
-Everything is falling apart. Bye!
-I don't present without you, Shruti.

02:35:28.166 --> 02:35:29.166
Listen.

02:35:29.333 --> 02:35:32.166
My hands were shaking,
my heart was racing.

02:35:32.291 --> 02:35:33.708
I was really nervous.

02:35:33.833 --> 02:35:35.416
I aimed for the heart,

02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:37.333
but I guess I shot too low!

02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:40.708
Too good!

02:35:41.125 --> 02:35:44.541
You're all mine

02:35:47.541 --> 02:35:50.666
You are my responsibility

02:35:51.041 --> 02:35:53.500
There are plenty of grievances, too

02:35:53.625 --> 02:35:58.458
In my obstinacy to defeat you
My life was lost to you

02:35:58.666 --> 02:36:01.000
If I ever made you cry

02:36:01.125 --> 02:36:03.416
I was also bereft of solace

02:36:03.583 --> 02:36:06.000
My heart is yours, after all

02:36:06.083 --> 02:36:07.666
It's all yours

02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:09.291
What do I tell you?

02:36:09.833 --> 02:36:12.416
The amount of solace I gained

02:36:12.666 --> 02:36:17.416
After getting this pain

02:36:17.625 --> 02:36:22.291
Feels like now

02:36:22.708 --> 02:36:27.791
True love is mine to claim

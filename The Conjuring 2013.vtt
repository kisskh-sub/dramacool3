ED: <i>Try us. Please, from the start.</i>

00:33.880 --> 00:38.886
DEBBIE: It started out small, like a hand
or a leg was in a different position.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.566
Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.769
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.490
It was moving around by itself.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.804
ED: Ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?

00:50.960 --> 00:52.644
DEBBIE: That's exactly what we thought.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.805
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.725
LORRAINE: And this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?

00:58.880 --> 01:00.291
Yes.

01:00.440 --> 01:04.161
Camilla got in touch with a medium. We
learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

01:04.319 --> 01:07.244
...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.121
She was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.643
All she wanted was to be friends.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.167
When we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.

01:16.360 --> 01:19.011
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.486
So...

01:21.680 --> 01:24.126
...we gave her permission
to move into the doll.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.282
ED: Wait, you did what?

01:26.680 --> 01:29.081
She wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.446
We said yes.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.001

or what to do. Can you help us?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.525
Yes, we can.

04:00.960 --> 04:05.010
Now, firstly, there's no such thing
as Annabelle, and there never was.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.242
LORRAINE: Ghosts don't possess such power.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.051
I think what we have here is something
extremely manipulative.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.168
It's something inhuman.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.841
It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.161
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.091
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.489
What's an inhuman spirit?

04:23.080 --> 04:26.527
It's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.809
It's something demonic.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.768
DEBBIE: So the doll was never possessed?

04:34.960 --> 04:36.849
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.361
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.206
Demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.442
It wanted to get inside of you.

You can shut it down now.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.809
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.850
Speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me last night?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.765
- Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?
- I don't know.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.764
Feel free to look around.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.804
Just don't touch anything.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.770
Wow.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.530
This is crazy.

16:25.520 --> 16:28.444
So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?

16:28.600 --> 16:32.571
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed...

16:32.760 --> 16:35.684
...or has been used in some kind
of ritualistic practice.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.004
Nothing's a toy.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.844
Not even the toy monkey.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.725
Don't touch it.

16:44.920 --> 16:49.403
Oh, ahem. Well, isn't it scary,
or doesn't it worry you...

16:49.560 --> 16:51.847
...to have all these items
right in your home?

16:52.000 --> 16:55.402
That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.

16:55.560 --> 16:56.766
Well, the way I see it is:

16:56.920 --> 16:59.571
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.529
It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.762
Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.848
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.170
Sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.204

17:16.119 --> 17:17.484

17:19.800 --> 17:21.086
Yeah.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.326
- You said she's a conduit?
- That's right.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.686
What does that mean?

17:33.840 --> 17:37.686
A very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.810
So when you guys investigate
these hauntings...

17:40.960 --> 17:43.201
...how do you stop them
from latching onto you?

17:43.360 --> 17:44.930
We have to take great precaution.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.724

17:47.600 --> 17:48.965
What about her?

17:50.080 --> 17:51.889
Well, Father Gordon told me that...

17:52.040 --> 17:53.530
Well, that was different.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.890
What happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.

of demonic activity:

44:38.040 --> 44:40.281
Infestation, oppression and possession.

44:40.440 --> 44:41.805
Now, infestation:

44:41.960 --> 44:45.931
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

into oppression, the second stage.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.491

procedure. Requires years of training.

And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

53:53.520 --> 53:57.241
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

gather evidence and provide proof...

[Ed]<i> Be with me Lord,</i>

00:55.958 --> 00:59.291
<i>Nor for the pestilence</i>

00:59.375 --> 01:02.208
<i>Nor for the destruction</i>

01:02.291 --> 01:05.291

01:05.375 --> 01:08.750

01:12.166 --> 01:15.500
[people] Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

01:15.583 --> 01:18.000
[Ed] There shall
no evil befall thee,

01:18.083 --> 01:21.291
neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling.

01:21.375 --> 01:24.166
[people] Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.916
[Ed] For he shall give
his angels charge over thee,

01:27.000 --> 01:29.375
to keep thee in all thy ways.

01:29.458 --> 01:32.291
[people] Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

01:33.416 --> 01:35.583
Let's take a little break,
shall we?

01:39.750 --> 01:42.625
Hon, are you feeling
all right?

01:43.416 --> 01:44.708
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.000
[sighs]

01:49.083 --> 01:51.458
I just can't remember
one quite like this.

02:00.958 --> 02:02.875
He should try and get
some sleep.

02:02.958 --> 02:04.333
Yeah. Here you go.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.916
-Oh, I'll take him,
Mr. Glatzel.
-Huh?

02:06.041 --> 02:07.375
Yeah.

02:07.458 --> 02:08.708
Thank you.

02:08.791 --> 02:11.833
-Thank you, Arne.
-No problem. Come on, buddy.

02:15.958 --> 02:17.500
He can't take much more
of this.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.250
He won't have to.

02:19.333 --> 02:22.166
Things will move quickly
now that the exorcism's
been approved.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.208
Father Gordon's already
on his way.

02:33.291 --> 02:36.041
You're one brave kid,
you know?

02:36.125 --> 02:38.375
I was a little runt growing up,

02:38.458 --> 02:40.666
so I know what it's like
to be picked on.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.291
But...

02:42.375 --> 02:45.375
But that was nothing compared
to what you're going through.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.083
I don't feel very brave.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.958
Being brave doesn't mean
you're not scared.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.791
It means you are scared
but you hang in there.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.791
It's gonna be all right.

03:00.875 --> 03:03.166
I won't let anything
happen to you.

03:04.541 --> 03:06.916
I promise.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.916
Arne. When are you gonna
ask my sister to marry you?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.041
[chuckles]

03:13.291 --> 03:14.791
I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:14.875 --> 03:16.666
-Come on.
-No, I don't, I...

03:56.250 --> 03:58.000
-[knock on door]

04:57.333 --> 04:58.916
[breath trembling]

04:59.791 --> 05:01.416
[tap knobs squeaking]

05:06.791 --> 05:08.125
No! Help me!

05:08.208 --> 05:11.375
No, no, no! No, no, no!

05:11.458 --> 05:13.083
[screaming]

05:14.916 --> 05:17.125
-David!
-[Judy] David! Where is he?

05:17.208 --> 05:18.208
[glass breaking]

05:18.291 --> 05:19.250
David!

05:19.333 --> 05:20.583
[David screaming]

05:22.666 --> 05:25.583
[breathing heavily]

05:25.666 --> 05:27.416
[Carl] What's happening, buddy?
Are you okay?

05:28.875 --> 05:31.250
David, what's going on?

05:36.625 --> 05:37.625
David?

05:39.041 --> 05:39.916
[yelling]

05:40.000 --> 05:41.625
[screaming]

05:45.875 --> 05:47.166
[Carl] No!

05:47.250 --> 05:49.333
Father, we need to do this,
right now!

05:49.416 --> 05:52.375
Okay, let's get him down
to the car and we'll drive him
to the church.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.625
No, Father. Right now.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.416
[David screaming]

06:03.166 --> 06:05.083
[grunts] No! No! No!

06:05.166 --> 06:06.583
[yells]

06:20.208 --> 06:22.333
Grab his arms, don't let go.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.666
[screaming]

06:25.041 --> 06:28.958
Save your servant
who trusts in you, my God.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.333
Let him find in you, Lord,

06:31.416 --> 06:34.833
a fortified tower in the face
of the enemy.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.583
Put on the full armor of God,

06:36.666 --> 06:39.083
that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.416
Against the powers
of the darkness of this world.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.375
Against wickedness.
[gasps]

06:49.041 --> 06:50.625
-[groans]
-Lorraine, what's wrong?

06:51.958 --> 06:52.875
I'm fine.

06:53.791 --> 06:54.625
Lorraine.

06:55.875 --> 06:59.000
Lord! Send him aid
from your Holy place

06:59.083 --> 07:01.416
and watch over him from Sion.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.041
-[sizzling]
-[screaming]

07:03.125 --> 07:05.083
Lord, heed my prayer.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.666
Lord!

07:07.750 --> 07:09.083
[distorted scream]

07:11.916 --> 07:13.000
[screaming stops]

07:13.083 --> 07:15.125
[rumbling]

07:22.083 --> 07:23.375
[distorted laughter]

07:24.625 --> 07:25.750
No. Father!

07:29.708 --> 07:30.833
[Debbie shrieks]

07:34.583 --> 07:36.000
[Lorraine] Father!

07:36.083 --> 07:38.083
-Where's your first aid kit?
-It's in the kitchen!

07:38.166 --> 07:39.083
I'm on it!

07:40.125 --> 07:41.500
Ed, hurry up!

07:44.125 --> 07:45.166
Hurry, Ed!

07:47.833 --> 07:50.625
Ed. Ed, Hurry!

07:50.708 --> 07:52.666
[reciting in Latin]

07:59.000 --> 08:00.500
[distorted laughter]

08:00.583 --> 08:02.208
It's not working!

08:03.208 --> 08:05.041
[continues reciting in Latin]

08:05.125 --> 08:06.875
[bones cracking]

08:07.958 --> 08:09.375
What? David, wait!

08:10.458 --> 08:12.500
Stop it! What? What?

08:13.708 --> 08:16.375
-[yells]
-[screaming]

08:16.458 --> 08:19.875
David! David! Help me, please!

08:19.958 --> 08:22.500
What are you doing? David!

08:22.583 --> 08:23.916
Help him, please!

08:24.000 --> 08:27.125
David, stop it! David! David!

08:27.208 --> 08:28.458
[screaming]

08:29.875 --> 08:32.000
-Leave him alone!
-Arne, don't talk to it.

08:32.083 --> 08:35.625
I said, leave him alone.
He's just a little boy,
you coward!

08:35.708 --> 08:37.375
No, Arne, don't talk to it!

08:37.458 --> 08:38.625
[Debbie screams]

08:45.833 --> 08:48.250
[distorted] I'll stop
your heart, old man.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.666
[gasping]

08:51.541 --> 08:52.541
Ed!

08:52.625 --> 08:53.541
[groans]

08:59.375 --> 09:00.416
Hey!

09:06.125 --> 09:07.875
Listen to me. Look at me.

09:07.958 --> 09:09.291
[screams]

09:09.375 --> 09:11.625
Look at me. I know
you're still in there, David.

09:11.708 --> 09:13.916
Just leave him alone, okay?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.083
Leave him alone and take me.

09:17.666 --> 09:18.791
Take me.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.375
-[gasping]
-Hey, take me. Take me!

09:21.458 --> 09:22.291
David!

09:22.375 --> 09:24.708
Leave him alone and take me!

09:29.541 --> 09:30.750
[breathing heavily]

09:34.375 --> 09:35.333
[gasps]

09:35.416 --> 09:36.250
No.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.958
No, no.

09:45.166 --> 09:48.083
David. David, David!

09:48.166 --> 09:51.166
David, are you okay? Hey, hey.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.500
David, go with Mom.

09:53.583 --> 09:54.708
Oh, oh!

09:58.083 --> 09:59.166
Yes, David.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.208
[gasping]

10:00.291 --> 10:02.833
Ed? Ed! Hon!

10:04.750 --> 10:06.000
What?

10:06.083 --> 10:07.416
[groaning]

10:15.083 --> 10:17.541
-Somebody call 911!
-Okay.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.791
Mrs. Warren.

11:18.666 --> 11:19.916
He's stabilized.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.541
We're gonna transfer him
to the coronary unit.

11:21.625 --> 11:24.625
-So, it was a heart attack?
-Yes.

11:24.708 --> 11:26.583
And not a minor one,
I'm afraid.

11:26.666 --> 11:29.750
-Can we see him now?
-Not yet.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.750
We're gonna to put a stent
into his artery,

11:31.833 --> 11:34.416
try to get blood flowing
back to his heart.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.416
[exhales]

11:38.500 --> 11:40.750
So, is he gonna be all right?

11:40.833 --> 11:44.500
We're gonna need to run
a few more tests before
I'm comfortable answering that.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.083
I'm sorry.

11:59.541 --> 12:02.833
-[Arne]<i> Leave him alone!</i>
-[Ed]<i> Arne, don't talk to it.</i>

12:02.916 --> 12:05.083
<i>Leave him alone and take me.</i>

12:06.541 --> 12:07.708
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

12:07.791 --> 12:08.875
[David screaming]

12:09.875 --> 12:11.125
[machine whirring]

12:12.541 --> 12:13.666
[whirring stops]

12:14.791 --> 12:16.041
Hey, the mummy lives.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.583
Hey, why did you let me
sleep so late?

12:17.666 --> 12:19.791
I didn't let you,
I couldn't wake you.

12:19.875 --> 12:22.375
-You couldn't wake me?
-No, I couldn't.

12:22.458 --> 12:24.541
Oh, that's strange.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.458
You mustn't have been
trying very hard.

12:26.541 --> 12:27.708
[Debbie] No.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.041
[dogs barking]

12:31.125 --> 12:33.166
-[man] Buddy! Easy, easy, easy!
-Okay, Bruno is right outside.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.666
Oh, come on.
Bruno's a worldly man,
he doesn't care.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.250
[laughs] No.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.541
No, no, wait. Actually,
I do want to ask you something.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.916
Okay. What do you want
to ask me?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Um...

12:45.166 --> 12:47.708
-It's no big deal.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:47.791 --> 12:50.166
-I've... I've been thinking...
-Mmm-hmm.

12:50.250 --> 12:53.000
And now David's
out of the woods,

12:53.083 --> 12:56.750
maybe we should
put all this behind us

12:56.833 --> 13:00.000
and get out of this place.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.916
-You know?
-You mean, leave Brookfield?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.291
Sure, why not?
We've got nothing keeping
us here now. Do we?

13:05.375 --> 13:07.041
Oh, yeah.
Nothing but my family

13:07.125 --> 13:09.375
and all the money
we don't have. Arne--

13:09.458 --> 13:11.000
Okay, well,
money's no big deal, right?

13:11.083 --> 13:12.291
We're both working,

13:12.375 --> 13:14.250
and this place doesn't
cost us anything.

13:14.333 --> 13:17.166
Arne, I just started this job.
I can't just up
and walk out now.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.208
-[Bruno] Jesus Christ!
-And besides,

13:19.291 --> 13:21.500
Bruno doesn't know
the first thing about
taking care of these dogs.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.875
Hey...

13:25.958 --> 13:29.958
Let me think about it. Okay?

13:30.041 --> 13:32.791
-You'll think about it?
-Yeah, I'll think about it.

13:34.833 --> 13:36.958
Okay. There we go.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.958
Okay, get dressed.

13:40.041 --> 13:41.583
I love you.

13:45.666 --> 13:47.625
-[rock music playing]
-I think David will love that.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.375
-Did you call my mom?
-[Arne] Yeah, I did.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.375
-I told her we were going
to be very late.
-Okay, thank you.

13:51.458 --> 13:54.416
No, Arne. Please stop eating,
please stop.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.166
Mrs. Haskett,
so good to see you,
thanks for coming by.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.041
-Hey, we're headed out now.
-Bye, Pookie.

13:59.125 --> 14:01.291
I wrote down a list of stuff
for you to do
while we're gone.

14:01.375 --> 14:04.875
Oh, keeping track of this stuff
is what I'm supposed to be
paying you for.

14:04.958 --> 14:06.125
Not on weekends, you're not.

14:06.208 --> 14:07.833
I'm letting you live here
rent free.

14:07.916 --> 14:10.708
That should buy me the weekends
maybe the holidays, too.

14:10.791 --> 14:12.958
Okay, Andy gets one cup,
everyone else gets two.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.583
Magic and Sparky are getting
picked up, so you don't need
to worry about them.

14:15.666 --> 14:18.416
But, you'll have to take
everyone else outside at some
point this afternoon.

14:18.500 --> 14:22.000
Oh, Ruby's allergic to bees,
if she gets stung you've got
to call the emergency vet.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.833
I wrote the number down
and stuck it on the fridge.

14:23.916 --> 14:25.125
[song faltering]

14:25.208 --> 14:27.833
Yo, Arne, you wanna make
a quick five bucks, man?

14:27.916 --> 14:29.583
My stereo's busted.

14:29.666 --> 14:34.166
Yeah, sure.
I'll take a look at it later.
But, make it 15.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.333
Ten.

14:37.416 --> 14:39.291
-...what happened this morning.
-I know.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.333
Ma, okay.
Please don't say anything.

14:41.416 --> 14:43.083
I won't say anything,
I promise.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.333
Okay, just...

14:44.416 --> 14:47.000
He asked if we could
leave Brookfield.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.833
-[gasps] You know what
that means, don't you?
-No.

14:49.916 --> 14:52.958
-Actually, you mean
he proposed?
-Not exactly.

14:53.041 --> 14:54.750
-Did you say, yes?
-Not exactly.

14:54.833 --> 14:57.458
Arne! Can you bring out
the tray with the meat on it?

14:57.541 --> 14:59.791
Oh, yes. I'm starving!
Are you starving, bud?

14:59.875 --> 15:00.750
Yeah.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.375
Okay, I'll go get the meat.

15:02.458 --> 15:03.750
-Ow!
-[chuckles]

15:19.916 --> 15:21.208

<i>Doctor Merrick, to OR-6.</i>

17:19.416 --> 17:20.541
[knocks on wood]

17:24.416 --> 17:26.958
It was nice seeing Judy again.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.416
Will she be staying long?

17:31.500 --> 17:35.333
I don't know, um,
it depends if...

17:37.750 --> 17:42.541
The nurse says that you
have been sleeping
in that chair.

17:44.375 --> 17:47.541
Ed would understand if you went
home for a little while.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.625
Did I ever tell you the story
of how we met?

17:53.708 --> 17:55.375
No, I don't think so.

17:55.458 --> 17:58.458
Just that you were young.
In high school, wasn't it?

17:58.541 --> 18:00.250
Yeah. We were 17.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.958
<i>I went out with</i>
<i>my girlfriends and...</i>

18:06.041 --> 18:09.083
<i>And he was an usher</i>
<i>at the movie theater</i>
<i>that we went to.</i>

18:11.541 --> 18:12.958
Afterwards...

18:14.000 --> 18:17.125
<i>we went out for ice cream.</i>

18:17.208 --> 18:21.041
<i>He took me out to the park,</i>
<i>but then it started to rain.</i>

18:22.666 --> 18:27.875
<i>And we stood under the gazebo</i>
<i>until it stopped.</i>

18:30.458 --> 18:32.666
That was 30 years ago.

18:35.666 --> 18:38.416
I could go back
to the house, Father,

18:39.916 --> 18:43.125
but my home is here
with him.

19:06.333 --> 19:07.750
[indistinct chatter]

19:18.291 --> 19:19.416
[sputtering]

19:51.375 --> 19:52.708
[buzzing]

19:54.000 --> 19:57.125
Jesus Christ, Arne!
What the hell?

19:57.208 --> 19:58.250
[breathing heavily]

20:05.083 --> 20:07.916
Can we please do something
about this racket?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.625
These dogs are driving
me crazy!

20:09.708 --> 20:11.666
[Debbie] They probably just
smell a rabbit or something.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.833
-How come you're not at work?
-I wasn't feeling so hot.

20:14.916 --> 20:18.083
[laughs] Arne!
Perfect timing, man.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.625
[dogs barking]

20:19.708 --> 20:21.791
Hey, why don't you come inside
with me, have a beer.

20:21.875 --> 20:24.625
If we get that stereo fixed
we can put up a sign,
close up shop.

20:24.708 --> 20:27.125
-You know what,
I don't think so, Bruno.
-Come on.

20:27.208 --> 20:29.458
-Why, you quit drinking?
-No, I just don't--

20:29.541 --> 20:32.791
Tell you what, we can
both quit next Saturday.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.125
How about that? [laughs]

20:50.833 --> 20:54.125
[weakly] Lorraine. Lorraine.

20:54.208 --> 20:56.291
-Lorraine.
-Daddy!

20:56.375 --> 20:59.208
Oh, Ed, thank God.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.875
Lorraine.

21:00.958 --> 21:03.416
-You have to call the Glatzels.
-She just called, you're fine--

21:03.500 --> 21:06.083
We have to warn them,
it's got the kid.

21:06.166 --> 21:07.333
No, it's fine, it's over.

21:07.416 --> 21:09.333
David is safe,
the demon is gone.

21:09.416 --> 21:12.583
Arne. It's got Arne!

21:16.250 --> 21:18.291
[rock music playing]

21:23.250 --> 21:27.000
It's beautiful, man.
Nicely done!

21:28.916 --> 21:31.625
Come on, man,
don't make me drink alone.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.166
Your girl's gonna think
I'm a drunk.

21:39.583 --> 21:40.833
Do you know...

21:42.125 --> 21:44.375
that I saw these guys
play in Sydney?

21:44.458 --> 21:47.125
They nearly blew the roof off
Her Majesty's Theater!

21:47.208 --> 21:50.083
Bruno! Can you turn that down?

21:50.166 --> 21:52.166
I'm testing out his work!

21:54.916 --> 21:56.458
[volume increases]

21:57.458 --> 21:58.875
[phone ringing]

22:06.583 --> 22:08.666
[muffled music playing]

22:11.750 --> 22:13.833
[breathing unsteadily]

22:22.833 --> 22:24.083
Hey.

22:24.166 --> 22:27.541
What's the matter?
Are you okay? Bruno--

22:27.625 --> 22:29.375
-Let's dance, brother!
-Bruno! No, stop!

22:29.458 --> 22:32.250
Bruno. Bruno! Oh, my Lord...

22:32.333 --> 22:34.583
Okay. Bruno, go night-night.

22:34.666 --> 22:37.916
-No! Not until we dance.
-Yes! No, we're not dancing.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.333
-One dance! One dance!
-I don't want to dance! Bruno!

22:42.416 --> 22:44.083
Okay, one dance.

22:48.083 --> 22:49.916
[laughing]

22:57.875 --> 22:59.333
[phone ringing]

22:59.416 --> 23:02.083
-This is Officer Thomas.
<i>-My name is Lorraine Warren.</i>

23:02.166 --> 23:04.125
I know how this is
going to sound,

23:04.208 --> 23:07.875
but there's going to be
a tragedy at the
Brookfield Boarding Kennels.

23:19.208 --> 23:22.125
[Debbie screaming]

23:22.208 --> 23:23.208
Debbie!

23:24.708 --> 23:25.791
[screams]

23:25.875 --> 23:27.458
-Arne...
-Bruno?

23:28.291 --> 23:29.958
No, stop.

23:30.666 --> 23:31.666
Arne!

23:33.541 --> 23:34.875
Bruno, stop!

23:36.666 --> 23:37.750
Arne, help me.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.708
-[roars]
-[screaming]

23:41.750 --> 23:44.250
Arne, whoa. What is going on?

23:44.333 --> 23:47.041
-What are you doing?
-[Arne yelling]

23:47.125 --> 23:48.208
Arne, please stop it!

23:48.291 --> 23:49.583
[dogs barking]

23:52.041 --> 23:52.958
Baby?

23:54.458 --> 23:56.000
-[music continues playing]
-What the hell?

24:03.625 --> 24:04.791
[music stops]

24:10.666 --> 24:11.750
[growling]

24:12.625 --> 24:13.708
[yells]

24:17.125 --> 24:18.708
[Arne grunting]

24:18.791 --> 24:20.708
[Debbie] No, stop!

24:32.625 --> 24:33.750
[sirens wails]

24:42.875 --> 24:44.541
[indistinct radio chatter]

24:46.916 --> 24:48.083
Hey.

24:49.541 --> 24:50.625
You okay there?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Hey.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.083
You okay?

25:07.458 --> 25:10.791
Now, you just stay
right there, okay?
Don't move.

25:12.666 --> 25:14.291
I think I hurt someone.

25:16.500 --> 25:17.916
<i>This is Sergeant Thomas.</i>

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
<i>I have one victim down,</i>
<i>multiple stab wounds.</i>

25:20.083 --> 25:21.750
[reporter]
<i>Residents of Brookfield</i>
<i>were shocked this afternoon</i>

25:21.833 --> 25:24.500
<i>by the broad daylight murder</i>
<i>of Bruno Sauls.</i>

25:24.583 --> 25:26.833
<i>Sauls, the manager</i>
<i>of a local dog kennel,</i>

25:26.916 --> 25:29.750
<i>was stabbed 22 times.</i>

25:29.833 --> 25:34.875
<i>This is the first murder in</i>
<i>that town's 193-year history.</i>

25:43.708 --> 25:46.666
[Arne]<i> Who shall ascend</i>
<i>into the hill of the Lord?</i>

25:46.750 --> 25:50.291
Or who shall stand
in his holy place?

25:50.375 --> 25:54.083
He that hath clean hands,
and a pure heart,

25:54.166 --> 25:57.125
who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity,

25:57.208 --> 25:59.583
nor sworn deceitfully.

25:59.666 --> 26:02.041
He shall receive the blessing
from the Lord,

26:02.125 --> 26:05.125
and righteousness from the God
of his salvation.

26:05.208 --> 26:07.041
[Ed] Right. That's enough.

26:07.125 --> 26:08.333
Thank you.

26:12.833 --> 26:14.791
Well?

26:14.875 --> 26:17.000
These religious objects
would've been enough

26:17.083 --> 26:19.500
to provoke an inhuman spirit,

26:19.583 --> 26:21.458
if there was one present.

26:23.208 --> 26:27.166
Does that mean
he's not possessed?

26:27.250 --> 26:30.125
The fact that he can read
from the Bible just seals it.

26:30.208 --> 26:32.291
So, what does this mean,
then...

26:33.250 --> 26:34.875
I'm just crazy?

26:36.291 --> 26:39.166
Well... you're not possessed.

26:41.125 --> 26:43.541
But that doesn't mean
that you weren't.

26:44.625 --> 26:48.333
I... invited this
thing into me,

26:48.416 --> 26:50.458
and that's the reason
that he's dead.

26:52.750 --> 26:55.208
So, you know,
whatever happens to me,

26:55.291 --> 26:56.833
I've got it coming.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.250
No, you don't.

27:00.416 --> 27:01.416
Look...

27:03.291 --> 27:04.750
I was there.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.083
Whatever is going on...

27:09.166 --> 27:12.333
whatever happened that day...

27:15.291 --> 27:17.041
that was not Arne.

27:20.833 --> 27:24.708
We're going to help you
in every way that we can.

27:27.500 --> 27:31.500
If the demon's gone,
what can you do now?

27:34.125 --> 27:35.416
Who's your lawyer?

27:35.500 --> 27:37.541
He was found covered
in the victim's blood.

27:37.625 --> 27:40.958
The murder weapon
belongs to him and it's got
his fingerprints all over it.

27:41.041 --> 27:44.208
Nobody's disputing any of that.
Arne knows that he's going
to prison.

27:44.291 --> 27:47.541
All we're saying
is that there were
mitigating circumstances.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.125
Mitigating circumstances?

27:50.208 --> 27:53.166
Look, I don't think
he should get
the death sentence, either.

27:53.250 --> 27:55.333
But I am not going
before a grand jury

27:55.416 --> 27:57.875
and saying he was possessed
by demons.

27:57.958 --> 27:59.250
It's never been done.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.208
Yes it has! It's been done
twice in England.

28:01.291 --> 28:03.083
The Michael Taylor case
was just a few years ago.

28:03.166 --> 28:06.708
Let me rephrase that.
It's never been done
successfully.

28:06.791 --> 28:08.625
Then let us help you.

28:08.708 --> 28:12.708
Ed and I have proven
the existence of the demonic
hundreds of times.

28:12.791 --> 28:16.125
You've proven it to the church.
This is a court of law.

28:16.208 --> 28:17.916
The standards of evidence
are completely different.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.750
The courts accepts
the existence of God

28:19.833 --> 28:22.750
every time a witness swears
to tell the truth.

28:22.833 --> 28:26.500
I think it's about time
they accept the existence
of the devil.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.208
How are you going
to convince a jury

28:32.291 --> 28:34.916
if you can't even convince me?

28:36.791 --> 28:40.791
I'll tell you what.
You come over to our house
for dinner.

28:40.875 --> 28:44.291
We'll show you the evidence
we've collected over the years.

28:44.375 --> 28:46.000
Introduce you to Annabelle.

28:46.083 --> 28:49.125
If you're not convinced,
we'll butt out.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.250
Deal?

28:53.416 --> 28:57.125
All right.
Show me what you got.

28:57.208 --> 28:58.916
[gavel banging]

28:59.000 --> 29:03.583
Mr. Johnson,
to count one of indictment
number S-A-J-1-2-1-6,

29:03.666 --> 29:05.708
which charges you with
first-degree murder,

29:05.791 --> 29:07.375
a class-A felony,

29:07.458 --> 29:09.083
how do you plead?

29:09.166 --> 29:11.750
Your Honor,
my client pleads not guilty

29:11.833 --> 29:14.375
by reason of
demonic possession.

29:29.250 --> 29:30.833
[bell tolling]

29:35.291 --> 29:38.291
This is ridiculous.
I can walk down
a flight of stairs.

29:38.375 --> 29:40.666
Oh, hush. You shouldn't
even be out of bed.

29:40.750 --> 29:43.375
Lorraine.

29:43.458 --> 29:47.166
I just talked
to a friend of mine
in the prosecutor's office.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.625
He's gonna go for
the death penalty.

29:49.708 --> 29:53.666
I'll build the case,
but that kid is gonna
either live or die

29:53.750 --> 29:56.000
depending on what you two find.

29:56.083 --> 29:57.750
Well, we won't let him down.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.208
[lawyer] I hope not.

30:00.291 --> 30:01.666
Keep me posted.

30:06.458 --> 30:08.291
So, what now?

30:08.375 --> 30:11.541
We've never had to prove
a possession after the fact.

30:11.625 --> 30:14.250
Demons don't just
disappear like this.

30:14.333 --> 30:15.708
There's something else
going on here,

30:15.791 --> 30:17.875
something that we missed
the first time.

30:19.958 --> 30:21.500
Where do we start?

30:23.333 --> 30:24.916
At the beginning.

30:28.541 --> 30:31.000
[Ed on tape]
<i>It's July 18th, 1981.</i>

30:31.083 --> 30:33.875
<i>This is Ed Warren,</i>
<i>here with Lorraine...</i>

30:33.958 --> 30:36.583
<i>and Judy Glatzel,</i>
<i>Deborah Glatzel,</i>

30:36.666 --> 30:39.708
<i>David Glatzel</i>
<i>and Arne Johnson.</i>

30:39.791 --> 30:41.833
<i>All right, let's get started.</i>

30:41.916 --> 30:44.833
<i>Who was there</i>
<i>when David first started</i>
<i>exhibiting this behavior?</i>

30:44.916 --> 30:49.541
[Judy]<i> We all were.</i>
<i>It was the day we moved in.</i>

30:49.625 --> 30:51.333
There you go.
Go have fun with them.

30:53.125 --> 30:55.291
-Wanna order some pizza?
-[Debbie] Yeah sure,
I'll do that right now.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.041
-Hey.
-[Arne] Put that box down
a second.

30:57.125 --> 30:58.583
-[Debbie] Why?
-I just...

30:58.666 --> 30:59.750
What are you doing?

30:59.833 --> 31:02.166
-Have a look...
-What is... Arne!

31:05.333 --> 31:07.291
You know you're supposed
to do this when you
get married?

31:07.375 --> 31:09.375
Okay, so maybe
we'll do that too.

31:09.458 --> 31:10.500
[Debbie] Oh.

31:11.833 --> 31:12.958
[Debbie shrieks]

31:42.833 --> 31:43.875
[hinges creaking]

33:21.416 --> 33:22.708
[screaming]

33:30.500 --> 33:31.541
No!

33:32.041 --> 33:33.125
Mom!

33:39.416 --> 33:41.125
[breath trembling]

33:51.166 --> 33:53.375
[David]<i> I didn't know</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

33:54.375 --> 33:57.083
<i>It was like a dream.</i>

33:57.166 --> 34:00.750
<i>And nobody believed me</i>
<i>when I told them.</i>

34:00.833 --> 34:03.708
<i>But that was the first time</i>
<i>I saw it.</i>

34:18.166 --> 34:20.000
I don't get it.

34:20.083 --> 34:22.541
How could he have invited
a demon? He was only in here
for a few minutes.

34:23.666 --> 34:25.583
There wasn't even anything
in here.

34:27.250 --> 34:28.833
Where was the water bed?

35:15.333 --> 35:17.875
You're going to ruin your dress

35:19.916 --> 35:24.291

about 15 feet in

35:24.375 --> 35:25.833
Okay.

It's just a rat.

37:56.916 --> 37:59.583

38:12.291 --> 38:13.833
[Lorraine]
It's a witch's totem,

38:13.916 --> 38:16.500
used by Satanists
in their rituals.

38:16.583 --> 38:19.958
Remember how I told you
that an inhuman spirit
needs to be invited?

38:20.041 --> 38:22.791
And you couldn't imagine
how David could do that?

38:23.916 --> 38:26.541
Well, you were right,
he didn't.

38:30.291 --> 38:32.541
We think David was cursed.

38:34.250 --> 38:35.916
And on the night
of the exorcism,

38:36.000 --> 38:39.375
the curse was passed
from David into Arne.

38:39.458 --> 38:41.041
Cursed?

38:41.125 --> 38:45.750
Are you saying someone
did this to us... on purpose?

38:45.833 --> 38:48.750
We've heard of
satanic rituals like this.

38:48.833 --> 38:50.458
The demon is summoned,

38:50.541 --> 38:53.000
the possessed individual
takes a life
and the demon departs.

38:53.083 --> 38:56.208
Which is why Arne
was able to read
from the Bible afterwards.

38:56.291 --> 39:02.083
Yeah. We think whoever
cursed David, used this
to draw the demon.

39:02.166 --> 39:03.875
And we'd like you to start
mailing these out

39:03.958 --> 39:06.041
to every police department
you can find.

39:06.125 --> 39:07.708
Start locally.

39:07.791 --> 39:11.416
And, just find out if they've
ever seen anything like this.

39:11.500 --> 39:15.791
There might be someone else
we can ask about this.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.166
Do you remember the priest

39:18.250 --> 39:20.750
who helped expose the
Disciples of the Ram cult?

39:20.833 --> 39:22.916
It would've been about
10 or 12 years ago--

39:23.000 --> 39:24.666
-Father Kastner?
-Yeah, you're right.

39:24.750 --> 39:28.250
Only it isn't "Father" anymore,
he's been retired for a while.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.583
He tried to help those people.

39:30.666 --> 39:33.958
He tried to understand
why they did what they did.

39:34.041 --> 39:39.708
If anyone is going to be able
to tell us what this is,
it's him.

40:04.541 --> 40:05.916
[Ed] Father Kastner.

40:50.208 --> 40:52.500

40:52.583 --> 40:55.833
No. But I've seen ones like it.

40:55.916 --> 41:01.000
This is sophisticated.
It's a very nasty piece
of work.

41:01.083 --> 41:04.166
What I don't understand is...
is why?

41:04.250 --> 41:08.291
David, the little boy
who was possessed,
he didn't do anything wrong.

41:08.375 --> 41:10.583
Why would someone
target this family?

41:10.666 --> 41:11.833
Why?

41:13.166 --> 41:15.791
The "why" is irrelevant.

41:17.791 --> 41:22.250
The "why" is counter
to everything that
the Satanist stands for.

41:22.333 --> 41:25.166
His sole aim is chaos.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.041
His nectar is despair.

41:27.125 --> 41:29.541
But someone had to
put it under their house.

41:29.625 --> 41:33.750
So, what does this tell you
about the person who made it?

41:36.375 --> 41:37.791
Come with me.

42:24.166 --> 42:29.416

while I was studying
the Disciples of the Ram.

42:42.666 --> 42:46.458
-You should burn all this.
-I've thought of it.

42:46.541 --> 42:51.333
But I felt it was safer
to keep them locked.

42:51.416 --> 42:53.750
I like taking guns
off the streets.

42:57.583 --> 42:59.625
I don't suppose you have
all these books organized

42:59.708 --> 43:01.916
using the Dewey Decimal System,
do you?

43:02.000 --> 43:06.250
No. No. No, I do not.

43:06.333 --> 43:10.291
The clues you seek could
be anywhere. Or, they...

43:10.375 --> 43:12.125
Or, they may not be here
at all.

43:13.583 --> 43:16.416
Ed, don't.

43:16.500 --> 43:19.333
[Kastner] I studied
these people for nine years.

43:19.416 --> 43:24.125
They worshipped
Satan and his demons
with blood sacrifice.

43:24.208 --> 43:27.833
They defiled holy land
with their obscene rituals,

43:27.916 --> 43:34.916
and they committed
acts of blasphemy...
which I shall never speak of.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.583
But... these acts gave
them power.

43:42.916 --> 43:48.791

43:48.875 --> 43:52.333
A few days after the Disciples
were all found guilty,

43:52.416 --> 43:55.916
his baby was born
six weeks early,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.833
with its heart
outside of its body.

44:01.458 --> 44:03.666
Three months later,
his wife committed suicide

44:03.750 --> 44:07.708
by laying her neck
on a railroad track.

44:07.791 --> 44:12.875
A master Satanist
is not an adversary
to be taken lightly.

44:15.791 --> 44:20.708

44:20.791 --> 44:24.583

to the death chamber...

44:26.208 --> 44:29.875
is saving him worth
everything you have?

very well cost.

Well, to be honest, not much.

48:39.541 --> 48:42.791
Only that if this totem works
the same way
as the one in Brookfield,

48:42.875 --> 48:46.333
it's possible that
your missing girl
was possessed.

what you two think happened
in Brookfield.

in reality.

48:55.458 --> 48:57.208

We were actually hoping
there might be something
in this case file

Arne's story.

55:22.666 --> 55:25.875
It's dumb, but,
I thought this was cool.

55:25.958 --> 55:28.875
It reminded me of the ones
we made in high school.

55:28.958 --> 55:31.666
Will you help me put it on?

55:31.750 --> 55:32.916
Sure.

55:38.083 --> 55:39.458
[panting]

56:04.875 --> 56:06.000
[gasping]

56:12.500 --> 56:13.541
[sobbing]

56:28.750 --> 56:30.166
All right, that's enough.

56:31.541 --> 56:35.416
Hon, that's enough.
That's enough! Come on!

56:39.291 --> 56:42.125
[breathing heavily]

56:42.208 --> 56:46.708
Katie? Katie? Oh, my God.
What did I do?

56:46.791 --> 56:47.791
Hon, no!

56:50.333 --> 56:51.458
Lorraine!

56:52.291 --> 56:53.375
[sobbing]

57:05.416 --> 57:06.708
[panting]

57:23.916 --> 57:25.250
[Ed] Lorraine!

57:30.166 --> 57:31.333
Lorraine.

57:35.541 --> 57:36.583
Ed.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.125
[screaming]

57:39.208 --> 57:40.250
No!

57:51.875 --> 57:52.916
[grunting]

57:54.791 --> 57:55.916
[both sigh]

57:56.000 --> 58:00.041
It's okay. I got you.
I got you.

58:00.125 --> 58:02.041
[Lorraine panting]

58:07.916 --> 58:13.333
She's down there.
Ed, she's down there.

58:22.958 --> 58:24.416
[siren wailing]

58:25.916 --> 58:27.791
[paramedic]<i> Blood pressure's</i>
<i>a little high.</i>

58:27.875 --> 58:29.500
I'm gonna give you
a vasodilator.

58:29.583 --> 58:31.916
It's a pill, you're gonna
put it under your tongue.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.791
It'll open up
your blood vessels.

58:33.875 --> 58:35.708
Yeah, I have those.

58:36.666 --> 58:38.666
I left them at home.

58:38.750 --> 58:41.750
[paramedic] Yeah, well,
I wouldn't do that
anymore if I were you.

58:43.166 --> 58:44.708
Mind giving us a minute?

58:51.500 --> 58:53.250
Recovery team found a body.

58:54.458 --> 58:57.083
-Is it--
-We're not sure.

58:57.166 --> 58:59.041
Look, I know what
it looks like.

58:59.125 --> 59:01.375
But, I don't want any of this
getting out until we have
a positive ID

59:01.458 --> 59:03.083
from the coroner.

59:03.166 --> 59:07.166
You know, we dragged
this basin. Twice.

59:07.250 --> 59:09.333
Had to pull teeth
to get it done
a third time.

59:09.416 --> 59:11.375
We never would've done it
if it weren't for you.

59:12.666 --> 59:14.625
I'm just glad we could help.

59:14.708 --> 59:16.291
Let me know where
you're staying.

59:16.375 --> 59:18.666
And I'll get that casefile
to you in the morning.

59:26.958 --> 59:28.500
[phone ringing]

59:34.041 --> 59:35.291
Hello?

59:35.375 --> 59:36.875
Oh, my God, I've been leaving
messages all day.

59:36.958 --> 59:39.666
-What's wrong?
<i>-It's Arne. It followed him!</i>

59:39.750 --> 59:41.583
You said this was over,

59:41.666 --> 59:43.333
but now he's trapped in there
with this thing
and it's telling him

59:43.416 --> 59:45.416
-<i> to kill himself!</i>
<i>-</i> Debbie.

59:45.500 --> 59:48.375
Just calm down and listen
to me. I need you to call
the prison chaplain, um...

59:48.458 --> 59:51.125
-Father Newman.
-Father Newman.
Tell him that

59:51.208 --> 59:54.666
<i>Arne needs to be put on</i>
<i>a 24-hour suicide watch!</i>
<i>He's got--</i>

59:54.750 --> 59:55.916
[static screech]

59:57.041 --> 59:58.666
What? Hello?

1:00:00.458 --> 1:00:02.208
What is this thing?

1:00:02.291 --> 1:00:04.000
[thunderclap]

1:00:05.541 --> 1:00:07.250
[thunder rumbling]

1:00:08.708 --> 1:00:09.791
[keys jangling]

1:00:30.250 --> 1:00:31.541
[lock clicking]

1:00:39.458 --> 1:00:40.750
[man] Arne.

1:00:42.625 --> 1:00:46.125
God gives everyone the right
to defend themselves.

1:00:51.041 --> 1:00:52.125
[lock clicks]

1:01:05.833 --> 1:01:08.041
[Lorraine] This demon...

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:12.750
it's not here of its own
free will. It was summoned.

1:01:12.833 --> 1:01:14.458
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

1:01:14.541 --> 1:01:18.208
That means, we know that this
is a curse,

1:01:18.291 --> 1:01:20.166
and curses can be broken.

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.250
All right.
Then, how do we do that?

1:01:32.333 --> 1:01:33.916
Back at the Glatzel house,

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.750
I touched David's hand
and I saw something.

1:01:39.041 --> 1:01:41.416
I didn't know what it was then.

1:01:41.500 --> 1:01:45.875
But I think that I was
connected to the person
who is responsible for this.

1:01:46.958 --> 1:01:49.708
Ed, that body they found...

1:01:49.791 --> 1:01:53.791
if it's Jessica,
if it's really her,

1:01:53.875 --> 1:01:56.916
then that connection
could still be open.

1:02:01.458 --> 1:02:03.583
There's gotta be another way.

1:02:28.375 --> 1:02:29.625
[gasping]

1:02:35.250 --> 1:02:37.625
Okay... okay.

1:02:40.583 --> 1:02:42.000
Okay.

1:02:59.041 --> 1:03:01.500
<i>The Lord is my shepherd,</i>

1:03:01.583 --> 1:03:04.500
there is nothing I shall want.

1:03:04.583 --> 1:03:08.750
He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures...

1:03:13.833 --> 1:03:15.083
[knock on door]

1:03:15.166 --> 1:03:16.541
[rattling]

1:03:25.250 --> 1:03:26.916
There's nobody there.

1:03:38.416 --> 1:03:40.208
We'll leave a note.

1:03:43.958 --> 1:03:45.250
[door creaking]

1:03:53.666 --> 1:03:54.833
[door closes]

1:04:19.166 --> 1:04:20.833
[switch ticking]

1:04:20.916 --> 1:04:22.416
Oh, boy.

1:05:18.416 --> 1:05:19.750
Please be careful.

1:05:32.916 --> 1:05:34.166
[whimpers]

1:05:50.916 --> 1:05:52.208
[exhales]

1:05:53.458 --> 1:05:55.041
Do you see anything?

1:05:58.916 --> 1:06:01.750
No. There's nothing.

1:06:04.208 --> 1:06:05.916
There's nothing here.

1:06:07.958 --> 1:06:09.958
I'm not sensing it.

1:06:21.333 --> 1:06:23.750
-Lorraine, what is it?
-The connection.

1:06:27.666 --> 1:06:29.041
It's here.

1:07:17.583 --> 1:07:19.125
[train horn blowing]

1:07:23.625 --> 1:07:25.791
[train engine chugging]

1:07:32.458 --> 1:07:33.791
[Ed]<i> Do you see anything?</i>

1:07:34.833 --> 1:07:36.083
Yes.

1:07:37.291 --> 1:07:40.666
Yes, there are... some stairs.

1:07:41.750 --> 1:07:43.500
I heard a train.

1:07:45.125 --> 1:07:46.541
<i>But now...</i>

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.625
there's an altar.

1:07:52.541 --> 1:07:54.166
All those black candles.

1:07:55.708 --> 1:07:59.250
<i>There's 12 of them.</i>
<i>In a circle.</i>

1:07:59.333 --> 1:08:00.375
Oh, Ed.

1:08:00.458 --> 1:08:01.875
Okay, that's enough,
come back.

1:08:01.958 --> 1:08:03.250
I can't.

1:08:04.125 --> 1:08:05.291
Lorraine.

1:08:05.375 --> 1:08:07.083
[switch ticking]

1:08:10.541 --> 1:08:11.625
It's a woman.

1:08:12.791 --> 1:08:14.041
[Ed]<i> Can you see her?</i>

1:08:15.791 --> 1:08:17.125
[Lorraine]<i> I am her.</i>

1:08:18.166 --> 1:08:20.125
Can you tell where she is?

1:08:21.083 --> 1:08:23.625
I don't know. I...

1:08:23.708 --> 1:08:24.916
[exhales]

1:08:26.208 --> 1:08:27.708
<i>She's doing it again.</i>

1:08:27.791 --> 1:08:30.041
<i>She's reaching out to Arne.</i>

1:08:32.958 --> 1:08:36.166
<i>She's trying to complete</i>
<i>the curse.</i>

1:08:36.250 --> 1:08:37.333
[gasps]

1:08:50.125 --> 1:08:53.416
<i>Oh, she has him.</i>
<i>She has Arne.</i>

1:08:55.250 --> 1:08:57.375
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

1:09:03.833 --> 1:09:06.125
No, no. Oh, God.

1:09:06.208 --> 1:09:08.375
End this black sabbath.

1:09:09.625 --> 1:09:12.791
By the blood of Calvary
I command it!

1:09:22.208 --> 1:09:24.875
I got a cutter! C-19!

1:09:24.958 --> 1:09:26.250
Come on, kid.

1:09:26.333 --> 1:09:27.958
[wind blowing]

1:09:39.416 --> 1:09:41.250
How are you doing this?

1:09:42.083 --> 1:09:44.125
God has shown you to me.

1:09:45.208 --> 1:09:48.166
Then your God has damned you.

1:09:51.833 --> 1:09:55.625
Ed. The connection
works both ways.

1:10:00.958 --> 1:10:02.041
[ticking stops]

1:10:19.875 --> 1:10:21.375
[switch ticking]

1:10:39.708 --> 1:10:40.750
Lorraine.

1:10:44.625 --> 1:10:46.625
You need to come back.

1:10:46.708 --> 1:10:47.750
-Lorr--
-[bones cracking]

1:11:02.916 --> 1:11:04.833
Lorraine?

1:11:04.916 --> 1:11:07.291
You need to break
the connection.

1:11:07.375 --> 1:11:09.625
Drop her hand.

1:11:10.583 --> 1:11:13.166
Lorraine, let go of her hand.

1:11:14.125 --> 1:11:15.000
[gasps]

1:11:15.083 --> 1:11:16.166
[growls]

1:11:20.291 --> 1:11:21.500
[Lorraine gasps]

1:11:24.333 --> 1:11:26.000
[both breathing heavily]

1:11:34.750 --> 1:11:35.875
Ed...

1:11:37.958 --> 1:11:39.833
She knows who we are.

1:11:41.916 --> 1:11:43.708
[thunder rumbling]

1:11:48.041 --> 1:11:49.541
[sighs in relief]

1:11:49.625 --> 1:11:51.416
[Lorraine] We are so sorry.

1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:53.041
[crying]

1:11:53.125 --> 1:11:55.500
Oh, we're so sorry.

1:11:55.583 --> 1:11:56.875
How's Arne?

1:11:56.958 --> 1:11:59.708
He'll be all right.
They got him sedated.

1:11:59.791 --> 1:12:01.666
We got the casefile.

1:12:01.750 --> 1:12:04.583
There's got to be something
here that connects these girls
back to him.

1:12:04.666 --> 1:12:05.958
That's great.

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.291
I got something
to show you, too.

1:12:12.166 --> 1:12:15.250
I found it in the Stregheria.
It's early Renaissance.

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:19.458
The Church used it to identify
and persecute witchcraft.

1:12:20.500 --> 1:12:22.416
Now...

1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:27.125
my Latin is rusty, but...
I think this...

1:12:27.208 --> 1:12:29.833
is talking about
a human sacrifice.

1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:34.458
One by murder
and the other by suicide.

1:12:34.541 --> 1:12:36.500
Does it say how to stop it?

1:12:37.583 --> 1:12:39.375
Yeah, it looks like...

1:12:39.458 --> 1:12:42.125
you can break the curse
by destroying the altar
it was cast from.

1:12:42.791 --> 1:12:43.916
But...

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.333
this part looks like Aramaic.

1:12:47.916 --> 1:12:50.750
This next part,
I can't read it.

1:12:50.833 --> 1:12:53.916
But you stopped her.
Maybe she'll give up now.

1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:55.250
She can't.

1:12:55.333 --> 1:12:57.750
Once started, the curse
must be completed.

1:12:57.833 --> 1:12:59.500
Her soul depends on it.

1:13:01.333 --> 1:13:03.291
We'll find another way.

1:13:04.541 --> 1:13:05.916
Was there anything
in your vision

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:07.875
that might help us
find her altar?

1:13:11.458 --> 1:13:13.166
It was cold.

1:13:17.541 --> 1:13:20.208
There was water dripping
from the ceiling.

1:13:22.250 --> 1:13:23.666
I think I heard a train.

1:13:25.708 --> 1:13:29.625
But it sounded strange somehow.
Like, um...

1:13:30.958 --> 1:13:33.166
I don't know, muffled?

1:13:34.208 --> 1:13:35.541
Well, maybe it was underground.

1:13:35.625 --> 1:13:38.500
Could be. I don't know where.

1:13:39.916 --> 1:13:42.208
This woman targeted
David and Jessica.

1:13:42.291 --> 1:13:43.458
Maybe there's
a connection there.

1:13:43.541 --> 1:13:44.458
Let me take a look at the...

1:13:44.541 --> 1:13:45.958
<i>Take a look at the...</i>

1:13:47.583 --> 1:13:48.791
<i>file.</i>

1:13:50.416 --> 1:13:51.958
[thunder rumbling]

1:14:05.875 --> 1:14:06.833
[groans softy]

1:14:22.416 --> 1:14:23.500
Lorraine?

1:14:47.916 --> 1:14:50.666
[leaves rustling]

1:15:13.166 --> 1:15:14.291
Lorraine?

1:15:23.583 --> 1:15:25.000
Lorraine!

1:15:25.083 --> 1:15:27.375
[breathing heavily]

1:15:42.666 --> 1:15:43.833
[indistinct clatter]

1:15:50.375 --> 1:15:51.708
[breathing heavily]

1:15:54.041 --> 1:15:56.333
Where is she?

1:15:56.416 --> 1:16:00.375
You know, the two of you have
gathered quite the collection.

1:16:02.875 --> 1:16:04.458
If you hurt her...

1:16:06.375 --> 1:16:09.416
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Warren.

1:16:10.041 --> 1:16:12.041
You're so close.

1:16:14.541 --> 1:16:17.250
I'd hate for you
to give up now.

1:16:19.083 --> 1:16:20.208
[loud thud]

1:16:23.250 --> 1:16:24.666
[thudding]

1:16:30.458 --> 1:16:32.500
[door creaking]

1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:43.750
[growls]

1:16:51.458 --> 1:16:56.041

-He who calls forth
the water of the sea!

The Lord of Hosts is His name!

1:16:58.416 --> 1:16:59.666
Deliver Thy servant

1:16:59.750 --> 1:17:03.166
from all the workings
of unclean spirits!

1:17:03.250 --> 1:17:06.000
Fear and flee, unclean spirit!

1:17:06.083 --> 1:17:09.541
-Ed!
-[breathing heavily]

1:17:12.708 --> 1:17:13.833
Ed.

1:17:14.541 --> 1:17:15.833
I'm sorry.

1:17:16.583 --> 1:17:18.500
Ed, it was her!

1:17:19.458 --> 1:17:20.791
It was her.

1:17:23.166 --> 1:17:25.958
-[Drew] Ed,
what the hell is going on?
-Help me find it!

1:17:26.041 --> 1:17:27.291
Find what?

1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:33.375
[Ed] Where is it?

1:17:33.458 --> 1:17:34.458
[Drew] Ed.

1:17:36.208 --> 1:17:37.333
Ed!

1:17:37.416 --> 1:17:40.958
She was here!
She was in our house!

1:18:04.708 --> 1:18:06.291
When did these get here?

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.291
They just arrived yesterday

1:18:12.375 --> 1:18:14.000
while you guys
were driving home.

1:18:16.250 --> 1:18:18.791
They were fresh
when they got here.

1:18:47.166 --> 1:18:48.166
[gasps]

1:18:53.958 --> 1:18:54.958
[sighs]

1:19:04.541 --> 1:19:06.583
[Lorraine] We have
to find this woman.

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:09.250
We've identified the curse

1:19:09.333 --> 1:19:10.791
and now we have
Jessica's casefile.

1:19:10.875 --> 1:19:13.000
There has to be
something in here.

1:19:14.416 --> 1:19:16.666
Okay, I'm gonna take the book
to be translated.

1:19:16.750 --> 1:19:19.666
There has to be a clue
about where we can
find the altar.

1:19:19.750 --> 1:19:21.041
[Debbie] So what do we do?

1:19:21.125 --> 1:19:22.833
You should go be with Arne.

1:19:22.916 --> 1:19:25.541
He's gonna need you tonight
more than ever.

1:19:25.625 --> 1:19:27.750
Ask Father Newman for help.

1:19:29.583 --> 1:19:32.708
Drew, you and me are gonna
tear into those files.

1:19:32.791 --> 1:19:35.000
We've got to find a link
between these cases.

1:19:35.083 --> 1:19:38.583
And a Satanist's power
is strongest at night. So...

1:19:38.666 --> 1:19:41.583
Let's hope she doesn't
try anything before then.

1:19:58.791 --> 1:20:01.166
They've stopped his sedation.

1:20:02.958 --> 1:20:04.708
He'll be coming around soon.

1:20:21.291 --> 1:20:23.125
[Drew] There's nothing
in these interviews.

1:20:23.208 --> 1:20:27.375
Her friends barely saw her
after she got back
from college.

1:20:27.458 --> 1:20:29.041
Didn't that
seem strange to you?

1:20:29.125 --> 1:20:30.500
I mean, we're here,

1:20:30.583 --> 1:20:32.458
the Glatzels live here,
just 15 minutes away.

1:20:32.541 --> 1:20:35.500
But Jessica lived
180 miles from here.

1:20:36.833 --> 1:20:39.541
Why is this one so far away?

1:20:42.458 --> 1:20:44.583
Hey, where did Jessica
find her totem?

1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.500
I just saw something
about that.

1:20:48.583 --> 1:20:50.500
It was in an interview
with her parents.

1:20:50.583 --> 1:20:52.250
It was in a box.

1:20:52.333 --> 1:20:54.875
"She brought it back home
in a box from college."

1:20:56.166 --> 1:20:57.875
Where'd she go to college?

1:21:01.333 --> 1:21:02.291
Fairfield.

1:21:16.375 --> 1:21:19.291
This woman lives in the area.

1:21:19.375 --> 1:21:21.458
Still a lot of ground to cover.

1:21:22.708 --> 1:21:25.250
Yeah, but not
a lot of train tracks.

1:21:25.333 --> 1:21:27.666
Remember Lorraine's vision?
She said she heard a train.

1:21:29.125 --> 1:21:30.416
What time was it?

1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:32.458
Maybe we can start
eliminating some of these.

1:21:32.541 --> 1:21:34.083
[Ed] Probably
close to midnight.

1:21:34.166 --> 1:21:35.958
[Drew] Then it can't be
either of these two.

1:21:36.041 --> 1:21:37.833
The commuter lines
don't run that late.

1:21:37.916 --> 1:21:39.458
That just leaves
this freight line

1:21:39.541 --> 1:21:40.791
that crosses the river here.

1:21:42.541 --> 1:21:44.166
The river.

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:47.708
Oh, dear God.

1:21:56.125 --> 1:21:57.208
Mrs. Warren.

1:21:57.291 --> 1:21:58.791
I'm sorry, Father,
we tried calling,

1:21:58.875 --> 1:22:00.708
but we couldn't reach you.

1:22:00.791 --> 1:22:04.250
We were hoping you'd help us
translate a passage
from this book.

1:22:07.416 --> 1:22:09.583
Of course. Come in.

1:22:10.208 --> 1:22:11.333
Thank you.

1:22:19.791 --> 1:22:22.708
Give me your keys.
You stay here, call the police.

1:22:22.791 --> 1:22:24.000
[Drew] What do you want me
to tell them?

1:22:24.083 --> 1:22:25.833
Anything,
just get 'em out there!

1:22:25.916 --> 1:22:26.958
[door shuts]

1:22:33.375 --> 1:22:35.416
[Kastner] It's the curse.

1:22:35.500 --> 1:22:40.750
It says, the curse needs three
victims to be complete.

1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.958
It refers to them as...

1:22:45.041 --> 1:22:48.833
"The child, the lover
and the man of God."

1:22:49.833 --> 1:22:52.500
The embodiment of God's work.

1:22:53.333 --> 1:22:57.666
Purity, love, faith.

1:23:00.583 --> 1:23:02.041
Has there been another?

1:23:06.375 --> 1:23:08.833
It's Ed. It's my husband.

1:23:11.875 --> 1:23:14.791
Last night we found a totem
in his office.

1:23:17.125 --> 1:23:19.583
That is unfortunate.

1:23:24.291 --> 1:23:26.916
Here, come with me.

1:23:28.916 --> 1:23:31.083
There's something
I need to show you.

1:23:50.041 --> 1:23:51.458
[floorboard creaking]

1:23:54.916 --> 1:23:56.083
Father?

1:24:57.625 --> 1:24:59.791
I've been here many years...

1:25:01.583 --> 1:25:03.750
starting when I was a priest.

1:25:06.250 --> 1:25:10.166
The church
used this mill for storage.

1:25:12.083 --> 1:25:15.875
It's where they put the things
that they were afraid of.

1:25:17.041 --> 1:25:19.208
Things they didn't understand.

1:25:35.791 --> 1:25:37.416
You had a child?

1:25:40.291 --> 1:25:42.708
Her mother died in childbirth.

1:25:44.583 --> 1:25:47.250
The Church couldn't know.

1:25:47.333 --> 1:25:51.041
So I raised her here,
in secret.

1:25:54.250 --> 1:25:55.666
It was just the two of us.

1:25:57.625 --> 1:26:01.666
Our happiness
filled this house.

1:26:04.541 --> 1:26:08.125
I continued my studies
into the occult.

1:26:08.208 --> 1:26:10.625
I wanted to protect her
from all this.

1:26:14.416 --> 1:26:18.125
Instead I created
a fascination.

1:26:22.166 --> 1:26:25.083
We must be careful

1:26:25.166 --> 1:26:28.416
how our obsessions are passed
to our children.

1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.833
"He who dwells in the shelter
of the most high

1:26:35.916 --> 1:26:38.500
will rest in the shadow
of the Almighty.

1:26:38.583 --> 1:26:40.458
I will say of the Lord,

1:26:40.541 --> 1:26:44.166
'He is my refuge
and my fortress,

1:26:44.250 --> 1:26:47.125
my God, in whom I trust.'"

1:26:54.291 --> 1:26:56.541
It's just the wiring.

1:26:56.625 --> 1:26:59.458
You know, state building.

1:27:01.666 --> 1:27:03.000
[Arne] Debbie.

1:27:03.666 --> 1:27:04.708
Arne.

1:27:10.125 --> 1:27:11.458
What is it?

1:27:12.833 --> 1:27:15.125
She's... she's close.

1:27:27.166 --> 1:27:28.666
You knew?

1:27:31.041 --> 1:27:34.625
We came to you for help
and you knew this whole time?

1:27:38.083 --> 1:27:40.000
She's my daughter.

1:27:42.500 --> 1:27:44.041
I couldn't...

1:27:46.083 --> 1:27:47.916
I didn't want to see.

1:27:51.500 --> 1:27:52.666
After all these years,

1:27:52.750 --> 1:27:55.083
I thought she'd come back
to me again.

1:27:57.250 --> 1:28:00.750
And now I know
the real reason she's here.

1:28:03.541 --> 1:28:07.333
There are tunnels
under this land.

1:28:07.416 --> 1:28:10.958
She would explore them
as a child.

1:28:13.416 --> 1:28:16.333
Her altar must be down there.

1:28:16.416 --> 1:28:20.291
It's the only thing
that can break her curse.

1:28:22.333 --> 1:28:25.041
We need to destroy it.

1:28:25.125 --> 1:28:27.458
[door creaking]

1:28:31.416 --> 1:28:32.958
She's here.

1:28:44.916 --> 1:28:45.875
[Kastner] Go.

1:29:27.083 --> 1:29:29.291
I failed as a priest.

1:29:30.750 --> 1:29:33.416
And I failed as a father.

1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:35.958
Please, God,
don't let me fail--

1:29:49.916 --> 1:29:52.083
[breathing heavily]

1:31:03.375 --> 1:31:05.000

1:31:15.791 --> 1:31:17.458
[footsteps approaching]

1:31:50.583 --> 1:31:52.375
[Ed] Lorraine!

1:31:52.458 --> 1:31:53.625
Lorraine!

1:31:53.708 --> 1:31:55.208
[Lorraine in the distance] Ed!

1:31:56.166 --> 1:31:57.333
Lorraine!

1:31:58.291 --> 1:31:59.375

Look at me.

1:33:00.791 --> 1:33:01.875
Open your eyes.

1:33:02.958 --> 1:33:04.250
[shushing softly]

1:33:05.458 --> 1:33:07.041
Look at me.

1:33:08.875 --> 1:33:11.166
[whimpering] No!

1:33:16.541 --> 1:33:17.666
Look at me.

1:33:17.750 --> 1:33:20.208
Open your eyes and look at me.

1:33:24.375 --> 1:33:25.375
Open up.

1:33:29.041 --> 1:33:30.458

...and lead us not
into temptation

1:36:23.333 --> 1:36:24.708
but deliver us from evil.

You're not gonna do this!
